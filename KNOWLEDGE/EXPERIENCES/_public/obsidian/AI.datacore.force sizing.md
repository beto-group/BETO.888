I injected a style tag directly in the React component that defined a CSS class (in this case, `.full-dc-stack`) with width set to `100vw` (viewport width) along with the `!important` flag. This ensures that the width rule overrides any other conflicting styles. Then, I applied this class to the dc.Stack component, forcing it to take up the full viewport width.
