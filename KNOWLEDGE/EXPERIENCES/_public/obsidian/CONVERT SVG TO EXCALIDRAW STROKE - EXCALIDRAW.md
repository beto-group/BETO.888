**Importing SVG Icons**:

- Download an SVG icon from Flaticon.
- Add it to your drawing with the import image function.
- Use Control S to force save the drawing after adding the new image.
- This ensures the "Convert SVG to strokes" action is visible when right-clicking the SVG icon.
- Excalidraw will attempt to convert the SVG to strokes.
- Note: This feature is not perfect and may not always work, but it is still useful.
