works and all i want to add some functionality to it.
so i need you to break down the input files as groups depending on the --- grouping within each file has 

groupd like this example

----
 info here 

----

more infor about another entry

-------

etc
____
some more


so sometimes ---- sometimes ___ and length changes so make sure you can handle all. and what you need it create an array with all those items from file and that array need to get display inside kanban . the last items meaning the one at the top is always the last item in array. 

so now i need you to add functionality where when i drag an entry into another column (which represents another file ) i need you to remove entry from original file and entry into the new file>

some files has specific starting syntax which are files with .enigmas. inside file.
so what i needs it skip the content and more the entry after header inside file
