Transforming the code

The user is looking to convert JavaScript code for a React-like component into TypeScript, aiming to maintain the existing structure without using import or export, and has provided example TypeScript code for reference.

Converting types

I'm working on translating the TypeScript for the first code snippet by creating interfaces. This approach ensures types align with the second code.

Transitioning to TypeScript

I'm working through the JavaScript code by meticulously incorporating interfaces, typing hooks, and ensuring components and styles are properly typed. The aim is to transition to TypeScript without changing the existing structure.

Converting code to TypeScript

I’m working through converting JavaScript code to TypeScript by defining interfaces, including 'initialSettings', and assuming React context elements like 'useState' and 'Textbox'. This involves updating the type 'dynamicColumns' to 'dynamicColumnProperties'.

Reassessing structure

OK, let me see. The JavaScript code uses 'dynamicColumns' as an array of objects, while the TypeScript code uses 'dynamicColumnProperties' as Record<string, string>. To avoid confusion, I'll stick with the JavaScript structure for 'dynamicColumns'.

Adopting TypeScript

OK, let me see. I’m adopting TypeScript interfaces and typing for dynamicColumns and groupByColumns, aligning with JavaScript while integrating styles as React.CSSProperties. This involves defining interfaces, components with props, and type helper functions.

Mapping out initialSettings

I’m aligning the dynamicColumns structure in TypeScript with the JavaScript code, utilizing dynamicColumnProperties as Record<string, string> to ensure consistency.

Flexing TypeScript definitions

I’m figuring out how to handle dynamicColumn properties in TypeScript, considering both arrays and records. Matching TypeScript to JavaScript is key, weighing dynamicColumns as either an array or a record.

Converting JavaScript code to TypeScript involves clarifying initial settings and defining helper functions and components with typed parameters for better type safety and readability.

Shifting to TypeScript

Mapping out the structure and typed props for components like EditColumnBlock, AddColumn, and PaginationSettings for a smoothly integrated TypeScript implementation. Progressing well!

Mapping out interfaces

I’m beginning by defining the InitialSettings interface, detailing vaultName, queryPath, initialNameFilter, dynamicColumns, groupByColumns, pagination, viewHeight, placeholders, and quickAddCommandId.

Shaping structures

I’m streamlining dynamicColumns as an array, keeping the original's Column type. This ensures clarity despite mixing tools. Again, this choice avoids confusion.

Tweaking the code

I'm adjusting the dynamicColumns array to Column[] and detailing the Entry interface for managing file properties like $ctime, $mtime, $name, $path, $frontmatter, and other dynamic fields. Progress is steady across its precise details.

Translating JavaScript to TypeScript

I'm working on converting JavaScript code to TypeScript, ensuring all components, helper functions, and state variables are typed with interfaces for clarity and maintainability.

Translating JavaScript
I’m working through converting JavaScript to TypeScript, setting up initial settings, defining interfaces, and creating helper functions and typed components, focusing on dynamic columns and React-like features.

Optimizing TypeScript code

I’m refining the TypeScript code for a recipe viewer in an Obsidian vault. This involves managing columns, pagination, and data filtering efficiently. The goal is to enhance performance by leveraging memoization and state management.

Handling file deletion and editing

I’m thinking through confirming and moving a file to trash, managing filters, toggling editing modes, updating pagination settings, and adding columns. The DataTable component views entries, while Pagination handles navigation.

Expanding functionality

I'm suggesting adding the groupSortOrders state to the View component in TypeScript, ensuring the EditColumnBlock and RenderRows functions handle sort orders more comprehensively.

Refining component details

I'm incorporating groupSortOrders in the main View component state and EditColumnBlockProps, updating EditColumnBlock, and implementing toggleSortOrder to manage these orders.

Refining interfaces

I'm refining the Column and InitialSettings interfaces. Typed helper functions and props for each component. Using React types for events. Adding groupSortOrders state and updating it when groupByColumns changes.

Certainly! Below is the fully converted TypeScript version of your original JavaScript code. This conversion includes:

Type Definitions: All necessary interfaces and types are defined to ensure type safety.
Typed Components: Each React component is properly typed with interfaces for props.
Helper Functions: Functions are typed to handle their respective data structures.
Styles: Styles are maintained with TypeScript's React.CSSProperties for type safety.
State Management: All state variables are typed appropriately using useState.
Note: Since you mentioned that you cannot use import or export, the structure remains the same, and components are returned at the end. However, ensure that the dc context and TFile type are correctly defined in your environment, as they are assumed to be part of your application's context.
