## 1. **Datacore System Overview**

### 1.1. **Purpose**

- Datacore is a **document query engine** designed for efficient block, section, and page-level queries with a built-in caching system for optimized document retrieval.
- The focus is on **DatacoreJS**, a **JavaScript API** for power users to create high-level views with JSX and TypeScript support.

### 1.2. **Challenges**

- Editable components, embedding mechanisms, performance issues, and query language refinements.

## 2. **Key Features Under Development**

### 2.1. **Editable Components**

- Metadata allows for editable components via a `Field` abstraction.
- The function to update fields is yet to be implemented; React components will handle interactive editing.

### 2.2. **Embedding Enhancements**

- Embedding support for tagged blocks is in place, but line-number embedding and further abstraction are in progress.

### 2.3. **Universal Visual Components**

- Developing reusable UI elements (buttons, dropdowns, textboxes) to create interactive views.

### 2.4. **Performance**

- Initial indexing is slower compared to Dataview, indicating room for optimization.
- Batching imports in groups of 8-16 and employing **WebAssembly (WASM)** with **SharedArrayBuffer** for multithreading are proposed solutions.

### 2.5. **Pre-Built Views**

- Plans for **table views**, **galleries**, **card views**, and lightweight chart views, with an emphasis on avoiding heavy dependencies like **D3.js**.

### 2.6. **Query Language Improvements**

- Enhancements like **infix functions** and an **in operator** similar to Python are in development.

## 3. **Current Problems and Solutions**

### 3.1. **Batch Processing for Speed**

- Batching imports to speed up runtime.

### 3.2. **WASM for Multithreading**

- Using WebAssembly and shared memory to improve concurrency and avoid blocking operations.

### 3.3. **Circular Dependencies in `dc.require()`**

- Handling recursive script loading and caching issues via a proxy object and `LOADING_SENTINEL` for tracking ongoing script loads.

### 3.4. **IndexedDb Performance**

- Investigating slow performance issues in **IndexedDb**, with suggestions like adjusting indexing configurations and handling bulk document retrieval.

## 4. **Future Work**

### 4.1. **Editable Components**

- Implement field updating and concurrent edit handling.

### 4.2. **Embedding**

- Expand API support to include line-number embedding.

### 4.3. **Performance Optimizations**

- Address idle time during indexing and improve task scheduling.

### 4.4. **Pre-Built Views**

- Focus on lightweight views like tables and galleries, with a cautious approach to adding external dependencies for charts.

## 5. **Problem Summary: Slow IndexedDb**

### 5.1. **Issues**

- IndexedDb performance lags, especially for bulk metadata retrieval.
- Investigating bulk operations, transaction management, and data structure optimizations to reduce latency.
