The document primarily focuses on its development roadmap involving enhancements to **documentation, testing**, and making it more **user-friendly** for those with limited JavaScript experience. Here's a hierarchical breakdown of the main points:


### 1. **Core Areas of Improvement**

- **Documentation**:
    - Need for clear, detailed guides to aid users in understanding Datacore's complexity.
    - Example vault creation for learning through working queries.
- **Low-Code Accessibility**:
    - Reducing reliance on JavaScript by introducing a **low-code** or **WYSIWYG** interface for easier query creation.

### 2. **Features Under Development**

- **Beta Release Automation**:
    - Use of **BRAT** (Beta Release Authoring Tool) for automating beta versions of Datacore for easier testing and feedback.
- **Low-Code Tools**:
    - Plan for a **query builder** and WYSIWYG editor for users without JavaScript knowledge.
- **Reusable Components**:
    - Using `dc.require()` for modular JavaScript/JSX component loading.
- **Pagination & Callouts**:
    - Features like pagination with scroll-to-top behavior and `<dc.Callout>` for emphasis.

### 3. **Datacore Query Language (DQL)**

- **Syntax Improvements**:
    - Enhanced with `$`-prefixed fields for querying metadata like `$title`, `$ctime`.
- **Query Optimizations**:
    - Minimization of post-query processing with efficient filtering and mapping embedded in the query.
    - Support for advanced features like boolean operations and accessing frontmatter data.

### 4. **Key Bugs and Fixes**

- **Tagged Blocks & Newlines**:
    - Addressing issues with blocks and tags, particularly concerning parsing errors with newlines.
- **Pagination & Filtering**:
    - Fixed issues with `$file` filtering and improving pagination behavior.

### 5. **Community Contributions**

- **Testing**:
    - Contributors without coding expertise can assist by installing beta releases, running real-world tests, and providing feedback.
- **Documentation Writing**:
    - Help requested in developing user guides for both basic and advanced Datacore usage.

### Actionable Next Steps

1. **For Contributors**:
    - Test Datacore features, report bugs, and suggest improvements.
    - Contribute to the documentation project, especially for low-code users.
2. **For Developers**:
    - Continue refining low-code tools and the Datacore query syntax.
    - Incorporate community feedback to improve user accessibility and feature set.



This outline provides a comprehensive look at Datacoreâ€™s development plans, existing features, and areas needing community collaboration.
