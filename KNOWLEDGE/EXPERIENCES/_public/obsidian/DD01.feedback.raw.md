Hi  I really appreciate what you are doing here. I am hoping to help out. Datacore is a bit beyond my Javascript level, but I can help with testing and documentation.


Yep, seems reasonable. I am going to start setting up automation for cutting beta releases that can be installed with BRAT to start...


Hey! Thanks a lot for your work! I'm also willing to help. I don't know if I have enough typescript knowledge to contribute to the code, but I also can help with testing and documentation. I'll take a look at the code to see if I can do something 😁


Honestly the biggest thing is going to be trying to use it... I'm setting up docs and an up to date beta so it's actually clear how to even use the plug-in, haha.

The new JS functionality is about two orders of magnitude more potent than Dataview was, but in exchange I'm worried about there being a learning curve.

depending on how the inline yaml works, i might be able to make an example vault relatively fast that others can use to look stuff up.

and there absolutely will be a learning curve. it can't be avoided with js/coding heavy plugins.

One thing that would be super valuable is if people have good ideas on how to tackle the "low-code" side of the plugin. I'm focusing on JS/code stuff for now simply because I can enable a lot of functionality with less UI work (which I am very slow at), but I'd like to make a more constrained version for making tables/lists/etc purely via maybe a WYSWIG, or a builder UI, or something.

i have sadly little knowledge about js and web page setup stuff so i won't be able to help with the coding side. i barely know enough js to get dataviewjs queries to run correctly.


Some basic docs will open up a lot of testing and help with docs. I am slowly working through code, but honestly haven't been able to get much to work 🙂


I don't have much yet but I'll collect it here: https://github.com/blacksmithgu/datacore/tree/master/docs


I'll try to put some complete examples in there which will probably help a lot with running things.


ahh looks like a good start!

that already helped. I am now getting some results. I was trying the old query syntax. 🙂

`datacore.tryFullQuery('@page and path("2-Areas/_Models")')`

my first working query

 will it be possible to do where like clauses on something like frontmatter? or will i return a result and then use something like .filter or .map to filter down the results more?

You can do it directly in the queries.
`datacore.tryFullQuery('rating > 7')`

I pushed as much as possible into the query itself since then I can do some pretty major performance optimizations.

It supports the entirety of the old DQL syntax... I have a few major things to cleanup there and also some dataview bugfixes I need to port to datacore.


The other big bit is what is all of the data you can search on... I've gotten rid of `file.<field>` and instead intrinsic fields start with dollar signs, like `$title` and `$ctime`.


I haven't figured out how to do variables with spaces in them very well, I believe you have to do `row["field with space in it"] = value`.

Some shorthand for that would be good but I don't know what the shorthand should be.

Wow, that is a nice evolution of the query engine

`datacore.tryFullQuery('LastName="Johnson"')`

where in the source code do define the syntax for the query language?

it should be here in the QUERY parser

[[DATACORE QUERY LANGUAGE]]



I notice in the docs it mentions "linkedto", but it seems in the code it is actually "linksto"

not sure if this is a problem with the code, or the docs. Linksto is working for me with tryFullQuery

I did it from memory so the issue was probably my brain.

No worries. Was going to submit a PR but wasn’t sure what was the correct intention.

Hihank you for your wonderful work on this plugin! I am currently working on an in-depth query for Datacore just for fun, pushing the limits of the plugin and exploring what it can do. I would be more than happy to share it once it's completed. I do have a couple of questions regarding the functionality within the plugin.

Firstly, I have encountered an issue with the pagination behavior in Datacore. When I use the pagination buttons at the bottom of a long query to navigate to another page, the new page loads but remains scrolled down to the bottom of the note. Ideally, I would like the new page to load at the very top.

I attempted to add this functionality directly into my query, but CSP restrictions prevented the necessary scripts from executing. Is this something you plan on adding to Datacore?

Additionally, what are your plans for allowing plugin users to create custom views and reference them, similar to the functionality in Dataview? This query I am working on is extremely long, and it would be much better to break up the code logic, CSS styling, and the Datacore query itself into separate files, allowing custom views to be reused across the vault. Will this eventually be possible?


I haven't implemented scroll-to-top for paging currently. I can look at it eventually or review any contrbiutions for it, though I'm currently focused on some other functionality before I would look at it.

For views, I'm replacing the `dv.view()` function in dataview with just `dc.require()`, which loads code similar to regular javascript `require()` or `include`, which should suit your purposes. I have some prototype code for this; I'll probably look at it again once I've finished up being able to edit metadata inside tables.


Thank you for prompt response, I truly appreciate it.

I understand that the scroll-to-top functionality for paging is not currently implemented. I'll keep an eye out for any updates or contributions in this area.

Regarding the custom views, I appreciate the information about replacing dv.view() with dc.require(). It sounds promising and exactly what I need for my queries. I'll look forward to when this feature is available and fully implemented.

Thank you again for your work on Datacore. I'm excited to see these new features and improvements in future updates.



I made a pr for this feature request.


I've added some comments to both PRs.

I've merged both PRs and cut a release. The scrolling behavior is now available by setting `Scroll on Page Change` in settings or setting `scrollOnPaging={true}` on individual tables.


Callouts are now also available via `<dc.Callout title={...}>{stuff}</dc.Callout>`.

Aww thank you!!! And a big thank you to  for getting this implemented so quickly. I truly appreciate both of you!


question: how would you import/reuse jsx components with datacore?

i.e., something akin to `dv.view(...)`


Maybe this helps, but I don't think it's implemented yet: https://discord.com/channels/1219902517304098836/1248850650457182292/1254702587744354376



done
https://github.com/blacksmithgu/datacore/pull/49

thanks for the tagged block example, that's exactly what i needed
Idk is it too early to report bugs (you said it's experimental), but i found some there... (version is today's: 0.1.9) 
- if the block starts at the begging of the file the first letter will be missing
- if file starts with one or multiple new lines `\n`  it seems to be very buggy
    - first tagged block will be replaced with next (untagged) one (if there is exactly one line between them)
    - and im getting some weird dot (like from bullet list)



this file starts with at least one `\n` 

this block have tag #tagged 

but this doesn't 

and this one has it #tagged 

```datacorejsx
return function View() {
    const blocks = dc.useQuery(`@block and #tagged`);

    return <div>
        {blocks.map(block => (
            <dc.SpanEmbed path={block.$file} start={block.$position.start} end={block.$position.end} />
        ))}
    </div>;
}
```


These were the exact edge cases I wasn't sure about - bug reports are appreciated!



I've released 0.1.10 which now works for both of your erroneous use cases - two separate off-by-one bugs 💩


 Does ScrollToTop only work on Tables? What about lists? Despite turning this setting on, my query still isn't scrolling to the top when navigating with the pagination buttons.


Datacore does not have an actual list view yet - what are you using for a list?

 fyi, filtering on `$file` no longer works
Fixed in 0.1.16, and it should be faster now.


 Would it be a good addition to have the pagination buttons at the top as well as at the bottom (especially if there's 100+ notes and you want to go to the next page without scrolling all the way down)? I suppose it's just adding another controlled pager inside the vanilla table div right?

Yes, this makes sense. I think I'll just add configuration which lets you put it at the top, bottom, or both.


Datacore does not have an actual list view yet - what are you using for a list?

My apologies for the late response. I am currently using a detailed list view created with DatacoreJSX, leveraging the `dc.useQuery` hook to fetch and display various media items (movies, series, books, music, YouTube videos, and Vimeo videos). Although it functions as a list view, each media item is presented as a card. The `ScrollToTop` functionality doesn't seem to be working for this card-based list view when navigating with pagination buttons. Here’s a snippet demonstrating the `ScrollToTop` function:


```
const scrollToTop = () => {
  window.scrollTo({
    top: 0,
    behavior: 'smooth'
  });
};

// Example usage within pagination handling
const handlePageChange = (page) => {
  setCurrentPage(page);
  scrollToTop();
};

// Usage in rendering pagination controls
<TopRightPagination
  currentPage={currentPage}
  totalPages={totalPages}
  setCurrentPage={(page) => {
    setCurrentPage(page);
    scrollToTop();
  }}
/>
```



Given the current limitations and the card-based list view implementation, could you please advise if there are any plans to support ScrollToTop for list views or any workaround to achieve this functionality? Additionally, I wanted to inquire about when you plan to expose the Datacore API for broader use, as this would greatly enhance the custom capabilities we can build upon.


1. Thank you for your assistance and for the ongoing improvements to Datacore. (edited)
    

 I don't have Nitro, so I had to split my comment into a thread. I wanted to share a brief overview of the key features of my query code along with some images, so you have an idea of what I have created with Datacore so far.
    
    1. **Pagination**: I have added pagination buttons at both the top and bottom of the list view, allowing me to easily navigate through pages and select the number of items per page right on the page.
    2. **Sorting and Filtering**: I can sort items based on creation or modification dates, alphabetically by title, and filter them by media type (movies, series, books, etc.).
    3. **Search Functionality**: It includes an advanced search feature, parsing the query to filter items based on title, director, actors, rating, and more.
    4. **Favorites Management**: I can mark items as favorites, which are then stored locally in the browser’s local storage.
    5. **Media Playback**: Clicking on media items opens a lightbox to play embedded YouTube and Vimeo videos.
    6. **Interactive Elements**: Titles are clickable links to the notes, tags are clickable to search the tag in the Obsidian vault, book notes have a progress bar for tracking reading, and rating numbers are converted to star ratings.
    7. **Responsive Design**: All the text, titles, buttons, progress bars, stars, tags, etc., dynamically resize based on window size and column count. The list adjusts the number of columns based on my selection.
    
    I have attached a few images that showcase a few of the features mentioned. Images:
    
    1. Media gallery in a 6-column view.
    2. Media gallery in a 4-column view with the 'Manhunt' series card hovered over, displaying detailed information.
    3. YouTube trailer for 'Manhunt' series displayed in a Lightbox.
    4. YouTube trailer for 'Manhunt' series paused in a Lightbox, showcasing playback functionality.
    5. Vimeo video displayed in a Lightbox.




Scroll to top has to be implemented on a per-view basis, so you'll have to add it yourself to your relevant views. Datacore specifically uses this:
```js
    const setPage = useCallback(
        (page: number) => {
            if (page != paging.page && paging.scroll) {
                tableRef.current?.scrollIntoView({
                    behavior: "smooth",
                    block: "start",
                    inline: "nearest",
                });
            }

            paging.setPage(page);
        },
        [paging.page, paging.setPage, paging.scroll, tableRef]
    );
```



1. Take a reference to whatever your root level container is and then use `scrollIntoView`, a vanilla js DOM function. The behavior is kind of finnicky and unreliable.
    
2. _[_10:55 PM_]_
    
    I will add this to the built-in card view and the list view soon, but if you are using anything custom you'll probably want your own implementation.




Thank you!! That worked perfectly. It might have been missed in my previous post, but I wanted to inquire about plans for exposing the Datacore API? Again, thank you so much for this amazing plugin. I am really grateful for all of your work on it, and Dataview previously.


This has to be one of the prettiest grid view I've seen in Obsidian. It has such a premium look with its background glass effect ✨


Which API in specific? Datacore does have a visible API through either `dc` inside of datacore views, or `window.datacore` available anywhere.


I finally got window.datacore to work! Thanks!




Might be worth including a small note on the docs/datastore.md that only datacorejs/jsx/ts/tsx queries are available at the moment.


Just want to say that datacore is already awesome, and I am very much looking forward to using it to emulate the parts of notion's database functionality that I use at work and want in Obsidian~




was just doing some testing to see how fast Datacore compares to Dataview, the result was astounding, worth spending a whole week converting! Top is Dataview, bottom is datacore





very small nitpick, but I think the empty values default string in settings should be `\-` instead of `-`, otherwise it creates floating empty lists sometimes!





Hmm, I thought it was, but maybe that's just because I set it to that 🤔
