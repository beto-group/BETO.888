### 1. **Advanced Handling of Dynamic Data:**

Based on your need to manage complex nested data structures like `mathLink-blocks`, it’s important to create flexible systems that can handle various types of nested content without rewriting code for each new structure. One strategy would be using recursive functions or a dynamic schema.

#### **Dynamic Schema to Handle Nested Structures**

Instead of manually writing code for each key in your YAML frontmatter, you could dynamically iterate through any nested structure:

```jsx
// Function to flatten nested objects for table columns
function flattenObject(ob, prefix = '') {
    return Object.keys(ob).reduce((acc, k) => {
        const pre = prefix.length ? `${prefix}.` : '';
        if (typeof ob[k] === 'object' && ob[k] !== null) {
            Object.assign(acc, flattenObject(ob[k], pre + k));
        } else {
            acc[pre + k] = ob[k];
        }
        return acc;
    }, {});
}

// Example: Use in View function for rendering nested YAML data in columns
const data = dc.useQuery("@page and #datacore");
const flatData = data.map(file => flattenObject(file.value("mathLink-blocks")));

const COLUMNS = Object.keys(flatData[0]).map(key => ({
    id: key,
    value: (file) => file.value(key)
}));

return (
    <dc.VanillaTable columns={COLUMNS} rows={flatData} />
);
```

- **Benefits**: This method will handle any future incoming nested data without having to manually add each new key as a column. It dynamically adapts to different YAML structures as long as the data is consistent.

### 2. **Deeper Querying & Data Manipulation**:

Handling advanced queries with multiple parameters, nested conditions, and dynamic attributes requires Datacore JS functions to be able to:

- Handle complex filtering/sorting
- Filter by date/time, status, or dynamically created fields.

#### **Complex Sorting & Querying with Multiple Conditions**

```jsx
return function View() {
    const raw = dc.useQuery("@page and #task");
    const filtered = dc.useArray(raw, array => {
        return array.filter(item => item.value("status") === "open")
                    .sort((a, b) => new Date(b.value("due")) - new Date(a.value("due")));
    });

    return <dc.VanillaTable columns={COLUMNS} rows={filtered} />;
}
```

- **Usage**: This allows filtering for only open tasks and sorts them by the nearest due date. Multiple conditions and date handling can be applied for more intricate needs.

### 3. **Handling Interactive UIs (Checkboxes, Fields Updates)**

Since you are exploring Datacore’s interactive capabilities, here’s how you could integrate checkboxes and live metadata updates directly within tables:

#### **Editable Metadata in Tables (Live Updates)**

```jsx
const COLUMNS = [
    { id: "Task", value: (file) => file.$link },
    { id: "Status", value: (file) => (
        <input 
            type="checkbox" 
            checked={file.value("status") === "completed"} 
            onChange={() => updateStatus(file, !file.value("status") === "completed")}
        />
    ) }
];

function updateStatus(file, isCompleted) {
    // Update YAML or frontmatter of file here
    dc.updateFile(file, { status: isCompleted ? "completed" : "open" });
}

return function View() {
    const tasks = dc.useQuery("@task and #project");
    return <dc.VanillaTable columns={COLUMNS} rows={tasks} />;
};
```

- **Usage**: This makes your UI more interactive, allowing users to check off tasks, toggle metadata like `status`, or update other fields dynamically.

### 4. **Managing Large Data Sets with Pagination & Lazy Loading**

For large datasets that could overwhelm the UI, consider adding **lazy loading** or **pagination** to improve performance.

#### **Efficient Pagination**

```jsx
return function View() {
    const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = dc.useState(1);
    const itemsPerPage = 10;
    const tasks = dc.useQuery("@task");
    const pagedTasks = tasks.slice((currentPage - 1) * itemsPerPage, currentPage * itemsPerPage);

    return (
        <>
            <dc.VanillaTable columns={COLUMNS} rows={pagedTasks} />
            <Pagination
                currentPage={currentPage}
                totalItems={tasks.length}
                itemsPerPage={itemsPerPage}
                onPageChange={(page) => setCurrentPage(page)}
            />
        </>
    );
};
```

- **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading where only the visible portion of data is rendered first and more rows are fetched and displayed as the user scrolls.

### 5. **Tracking and Persisting New Types of Data**:

To manage incoming types of data (like new YAML structures, file formats, etc.), you need to implement a **versioned data schema** or an adaptable parser that logs and tracks new structures.

#### **Schema Versioning for New YAML Fields**

Implement a function that checks the incoming data format and adapts accordingly:

```jsx
function detectAndAdaptSchema(file) {
    if (file.value("schemaVersion") === "1.0") {
        return file.value("oldFieldName");
    } else if (file.value("schemaVersion") === "2.0") {
        return file.value("newFieldName");
    }
    return file.value("defaultField");
}
```

This allows you to handle future changes in YAML data formats or any additional types of metadata that may come in, without breaking existing functionalities.

### 6. **Setting Up Automation for Daily Quotes or Summaries**:

You mentioned an idea about saving important information and getting random quotes emailed daily. Here's how you can extend this:

#### **Automated Email Reminders**

Use a **cron job** that selects random quotes and emails them:

- Set up an external email service (like SendGrid or Mailgun).
    
- Automate the extraction and selection of quotes or highlights:
    
```jsx
const quotes = dc.useQuery("@quote"); const randomQuote = quotes[Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length)]; // Email service integration sendEmail("Your daily quote", randomQuote.value("text"));
```
    
- **Summary Emails**: You could extend this to pull in highlights or important tasks and automate sending summaries every day, using similar querying logic.
    

### 7. **Building More Complex Workflows**:

Finally, creating complete workflows from tracking to visualizing and interacting with data will take your project further. For example, creating **kanban boards** or **task management views** that let you move tasks around dynamically:

#### **Example: Interactive Task Board**

```jsx
return function TaskBoard() {
    const tasks = dc.useQuery("@task");

    return (
        <div className="task-board">
            <div className="column">
                <h2>To Do</h2>
                {tasks.filter(task => task.value("status") === "open").map(renderTask)}
            </div>
            <div className="column">
                <h2>Completed</h2>
                {tasks.filter(task => task.value("status") === "completed").map(renderTask)}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
};

function renderTask(task) {
    return (
        <div className="task-card" onClick={() => toggleTaskStatus(task)}>
            <h3>{task.value("name")}</h3>
            <p>{task.value("description")}</p>
        </div>
    );
}

function toggleTaskStatus(task) {
    const newStatus = task.value("status") === "completed" ? "open" : "completed";
    dc.updateFile(task, { status: newStatus });
}
```

---

### **Tracking and Adapting to New Information**:

1. **Dynamic Data Handling**: Use recursive functions and schema detection to handle unknown or evolving YAML data structures.
2. **Live UI Interaction**: Add interactivity to UI elements like checkboxes, inline field updates, and editable metadata for real-time interactions.
3. **Pagination & Performance**: Optimize handling of large datasets with pagination and lazy loading to keep the interface fast and responsive.
4. **Automation**: Implement automated workflows (email reminders, task summaries) with external services for smoother operations.

# BREAKDOWN DEEPER


### Troubleshooting the Issue:

1. **Empty Bullet / Lack of Rendering:** It appears that you’re seeing an empty bullet in the user interface, and when checking the developer console, the output is visible. This suggests that your syntax and logic for querying the data might be correct, but the issue lies in how the table or the view is being rendered.
    
    - **Ensure a Proper Render Function:** In React-based setups like this, it’s critical to have a correct render function. You're already returning a function called `View`, which should handle rendering.
    - **Component Returning Empty Content:** If the table is empty, this could be because:
        - Your query returns no data (`games` may be empty).
        - There's a rendering issue in `dc.VanillaTable` or how it's handling grouped data.
2. **Rendering Data Correctly:**
    
    - **Check the Data Being Queried:** Since you confirmed that the commands work in the console, this suggests that data is being fetched correctly. Make sure the structure of the data (`grouped`) is valid for the table component. You could `console.log(games)` before the grouping logic to ensure the data is properly fetched.
    - **Console Logs:** You’re already logging `grouped`. Verify that this array contains properly structured data for the table to render.
3. **Handling Nullable Fields:** You've mentioned needing to improve abstractions for nullable fields. In the current example, the `timePlayed` logic handles `null` or undefined values. The function could potentially return undefined, which could cause issues during rendering.
    
    - **Improve the `timePlayed` Function:** Ensure it’s robust enough to handle all edge cases:
        
```js
function timePlayed(input) {
    let raw = input.value("time played") ?? input.value("time-played");
    while (Array.isArray(raw)) raw = raw[0];

    if (typeof raw !== "number") return undefined;  // Ensure it returns a proper value
    return raw;
}
```
        
4. **Ensure Grouping Logic is Correct:** The `grouped` array is being constructed using `dc.useArray`, where you're applying sorting and grouping. The issue could be with how you're sorting or grouping. Double-check the structure and whether the key you're using (`timePlayed(x)?.year`) exists for all items.
    
    **Tip**: To avoid rendering empty tables due to missing or invalid data:
    
```js
if (!grouped || grouped.length === 0) {
    return <div>No data available</div>;
}
```
    

### Complete Example (Adjusted):

Here’s your code with some improvements to help catch potential rendering issues and handle nullable fields better:

```jsx
datacorejsx

const COLUMNS = [
    { id: "Game", value: (game) => game.$link },
    { id: "Time Played", value: (game) => game.value("time played") ?? game.value("time-played") },
    { id: "Length", value: (game) => game.value("length") },
    { id: "Tags", value: (game) => game.$tags.filter(t => t.startsWith("#game/")).join(" ") },
    { id: "Rating", value: (game) => game.value("rating") }
];

function timePlayed(input) {
    let raw = input.value("time played") ?? input.value("time-played");
    while (Array.isArray(raw)) raw = raw[0];

    if (typeof raw !== "number") return undefined; // Return undefined if it's not a number
    return raw;
}

return function View() {
    const games = dc.useQuery("#game and @page");

    // Early return for empty data
    if (!games || games.length === 0) {
        return <div>No games found</div>;
    }

    const grouped = dc.useArray(games, array => {
        return array
            .sort(x => timePlayed(x), 'desc')
            .groupBy(x => timePlayed(x)?.year)
            .sort(x => x.key, 'desc');
    });

    console.log("Grouped data:", grouped);

    // Early return for empty grouped data
    if (!grouped || grouped.length === 0) {
        return <div>No grouped data found</div>;
    }

    return (
        <dc.VanillaTable columns={COLUMNS} rows={grouped} />
    );
}
```

### Additional Thoughts:

- **Rendering Issues:** If you're still seeing issues with nothing rendering, try simplifying the return logic of `View` initially by removing some features like sorting and grouping. Start by rendering the raw `games` data directly in a basic table to rule out issues with more complex logic.
    
- **VanillaTable Customization:** Make sure that `dc.VanillaTable` is capable of handling the structure you're passing. If `grouped` is not structured correctly, you might see rendering issues.
    

### For Non-Coders:

If you're not familiar with coding, this plugin might indeed be tricky to use as it's heavily reliant on JavaScript and React. If you're starting, try small, simple views without grouping or complex logic until you get the hang of it!






It looks like you're trying to build a query and display system for data in **DatacoreJS**, particularly YAML data stored within notes. You want to fetch specific YAML fields (`test`, `name`, `when`, `file`) from your notes and display them in a table. In addition, you're also looking for ways to replicate similar functionality to DataviewJS, such as handling links (inlinks and outlinks).

### Display YAML Fields in Columns

To achieve this, we can use `dc.useQuery` to fetch blocks of notes that contain the YAML metadata and display them in a table, similar to how you described it. Here's a simple breakdown based on your provided YAML data and JavaScript example:

#### YAML Example Data:

```
---
test: 1
name: "Dovos"
when: 2023-05-21
file: "[[@Dovos]]"
---

---
test: 2
name: "Daniel"
when: 2000-05-21
file: "[[@Daniel @NL]]"
---
```

This data needs to be queried, parsed, and displayed in separate columns. Here's a more fleshed-out version of your example code:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

```jsx
datacorejsx

const COLUMNS = [
  { id: "Test", value: (item) => item.value("test") },  // Fetch 'test' field
  { id: "Name", value: (item) => item.value("name") },  // Fetch 'name' field
  { id: "When", value: (item) => item.value("when") },  // Fetch 'when' field
  { id: "File", value: (item) => item.value("file") }   // Fetch 'file' field
];

return function View() {
  // Query all pages containing YAML blocks
  const items = dc.useQuery("@datablock");

  // Sort by 'test' field in descending order
  const sortedItems = dc.useArray(items, array => array.sort((a, b) => b.value("test") - a.value("test")));

  // Render the table with columns and rows (grouped/sorted items)
  return (
    <>
      <h1>YAML Data Table</h1>
      <dc.VanillaTable columns={COLUMNS} rows={sortedItems}/>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Columns Setup:** The `COLUMNS` array specifies how each column should display data from your YAML:
    
    - `id: "Test"` will show the value from the `test` field.
    - `id: "Name"` will show the `name` field.
    - `id: "When"` will show the `when` field.
    - `id: "File"` will show the `file` field.
2. **Fetching YAML Data:** `dc.useQuery("@datablock")` is used to fetch notes or pages containing a YAML block. You can adjust the query to refine the selection based on specific tags or other criteria. This method fetches all notes containing a `@datablock`, which is a placeholder for where the YAML resides.
    
3. **Sorting:** You’re sorting the items by their `test` field in descending order, using `dc.useArray`. Sorting helps ensure that the items are ordered by the `test` field numerically, with higher numbers appearing first.
    
4. **Displaying the Table:** The `dc.VanillaTable` component renders the queried and sorted data as a table. Each row corresponds to a note (or YAML block), and each column displays the values for `test`, `name`, `when`, and `file`.
    

### Handling Inlinks and Outlinks:

If you want to replicate the functionality for displaying **inlinks** and **outlinks** (like you did with **DataviewJS**), the solution would involve querying the current note's backlinks and frontlinks and displaying them in a similar table. Unfortunately, DatacoreJS might not have built-in methods for `inlinks` and `outlinks` like DataviewJS. However, you can manually gather those links and display them.

Here’s an approach to replicate a similar two-column table for **inlinks** and **outlinks**:

```jsx
datacorejsx

return function View() {
  // Get the current page and its backlinks (inlinks)
  const currentNote = dc.usePage();
  const inlinks = currentNote?.$inlinks ?? [];  // Fallback to empty array if no inlinks
  const outlinks = currentNote?.$outlinks ?? [];  // Fallback to empty array if no outlinks

  // Create an index for iterating both arrays
  const maxLength = Math.max(inlinks.length, outlinks.length);
  const data = Array.from({ length: maxLength }, (_, index) => [
    inlinks[index] ? inlinks[index].$link : " ",  // Show empty space if no inlink at this index
    outlinks[index] ? outlinks[index].$link : " "  // Show empty space if no outlink at this index
  ]);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Inlinks and Outlinks</h1>
      <dc.VanillaTable
        columns={[
          { id: "Inlinks", value: (row) => row[0] },  // First column is for inlinks
          { id: "Outlinks", value: (row) => row[1] }  // Second column is for outlinks
        ]}
        rows={data}  // Pass the data array with both inlinks and outlinks
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Fetching Inlinks and Outlinks:**
    
    - `currentNote?.$inlinks`: This fetches the inlinks (backlinks) of the current note.
    - `currentNote?.$outlinks`: This fetches the outlinks (links from the current note to others). If there are no links, we fallback to an empty array (`[]`).
2. **Data Formatting:**
    
    - We calculate the maximum length between the `inlinks` and `outlinks` arrays to ensure we can loop through both.
    - Using `Array.from()`, we generate an index and for each position, either place the link or an empty space (`" "`) in case there is no link at that index.
3. **Displaying Links:** We use `dc.VanillaTable` to display two columns: one for **inlinks** and one for **outlinks**.
    

### Final Thoughts:

- **For YAML Data Queries:** Use the `dc.useQuery("@datablock")` to fetch and display YAML content in a table format.
- **For Inlinks and Outlinks:** Manually fetch the links using `currentNote?.$inlinks` and `currentNote?.$outlinks`, and display them in a two-column table.







It looks like you've already made significant progress in using **DatacoreJS** for your custom views, but you noticed some quirks with the outlinks query. Specifically, you're seeing **more outlinks than expected**, likely because the query you used also retrieves links from the files it finds. You’ve adjusted your code to correctly use the current file’s `$links` property for outgoing links, which seems to resolve the issue.

To address the points you raised and clean up the code a bit, let’s clarify and optimize the approach.

### Key Changes:

1. **Incoming Links**: Your query for `incoming` is correctly fetching the pages that link to the current file.
2. **Outgoing Links**: You can use `current.value("$links")` to get just the links _from_ the current file, without pulling in links from other files, which was the issue with your previous query.

Let’s improve the readability and optimize the structure a little bit.

### Revised Code with Explanation:

```jsx
return function View() {
    const current = dc.useCurrentFile();  // Get the current file's metadata

    // Query for incoming links (files that link to the current file)
    const incoming = dc.useQuery(`@page and linksto(id("${current.$path}"))`).filter(entry => entry.$link);

    // Get the current file's outgoing links (files that this file links to)
    const outgoing = current.value("$links");

    return (
        <table className="datacore-table">
            <tr>
                <td><b>Inlinks</b></td>
                <td>
                    {incoming.map(entry => (
                        <span style="margin: 4px; padding: 4px; background-color: var(--interactive-before);">
                            <dc.Link link={entry.$link} />
                        </span>
                    ))}
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Outlinks</b></td>
                <td>
                    {outgoing.map(link => (
                        <span style="margin: 4px; padding: 4px; background-color: var(--interactive-before);">
                            <dc.Link link={link.path} />
                        </span>
                    ))}
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    );
}
```

### Key Points:

1. **Incoming Links** (`incoming`):
    
    - This uses the query `@page and linksto(id("${current.$path}"))`, which pulls in all pages that link **to** the current file.
    - The `filter` ensures you only get valid links (`entry.$link`).
    - Each incoming link is displayed in the first row under the "Inlinks" column.
2. **Outgoing Links** (`outgoing`):
    
    - Instead of querying, you’re now using `current.value("$links")`, which directly provides the links **from** the current file to other files. This avoids the issue where the previous query returned links both from the current file and the files it found.
    - Each outgoing link is displayed in the second row under the "Outlinks" column.
3. **Rendering Links**:
    
    - The `dc.Link` component renders the link properly in the table.
    - You’ve applied some inline CSS styles (`margin`, `padding`, and `background-color`) to give it a more distinct appearance.

### Why This Fixes the Outlink Issue:

Previously, your query for outgoing links was too broad and retrieved links _from_ other files as well, not just the current file’s links. By switching to `current.value("$links")`, you get only the links _directly_ from the current file.

### Suggestions for Styling and Layout Flexibility:

You also mentioned the possibility of **emitting arbitrary HTML** and styling beyond tables and lists. Since DatacoreJS allows this flexibility, you could:

- Use more advanced CSS to style your tables, such as custom colors, borders, or responsive layouts.
- Switch to a vertical layout, if desired, by modifying the table structure or using `<div>` elements instead of `<table>`.

Here’s a more vertically oriented layout example:

```jsx
return function View() {
    const current = dc.useCurrentFile();
    const incoming = dc.useQuery(`@page and linksto(id("${current.$path}"))`).filter(entry => entry.$link);
    const outgoing = current.value("$links");

    return (
        <div>
            <div>
                <h3>Inlinks</h3>
                {incoming.length > 0 ? (
                    incoming.map(entry => (
                        <div style="margin: 4px; padding: 4px; background-color: var(--interactive-before);">
                            <dc.Link link={entry.$link} />
                        </div>
                    ))
                ) : (
                    <p>No inlinks found.</p>
                )}
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Outlinks</h3>
                {outgoing.length > 0 ? (
                    outgoing.map(link => (
                        <div style="margin: 4px; padding: 4px; background-color: var(--interactive-before);">
                            <dc.Link link={link.path} />
                        </div>
                    ))
                ) : (
                    <p>No outlinks found.</p>
                )}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}return function View() {
    const current = dc.useCurrentFile();
    const incoming = dc.useQuery(`@page and linksto(id("${current.$path}"))`).filter(entry => entry.$link);
    const outgoing = current.value("$links");

    return (
        <div>
            <div>
                <h3>Inlinks</h3>
                {incoming.length > 0 ? (
                    incoming.map(entry => (
                        <div style="margin: 4px; padding: 4px; background-color: var(--interactive-before);">
                            <dc.Link link={entry.$link} />
                        </div>
                    ))
                ) : (
                    <p>No inlinks found.</p>
                )}
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Outlinks</h3>
                {outgoing.length > 0 ? (
                    outgoing.map(link => (
                        <div style="margin: 4px; padding: 4px; background-color: var(--interactive-before);">
                            <dc.Link link={link.path} />
                        </div>
                    ))
                ) : (
                    <p>No outlinks found.</p>
                )}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```
### Key Changes:

- We replaced the `<table>` with `<div>` elements for a vertical layout.
- Added headers for "Inlinks" and "Outlinks".
- Used conditional rendering to display a message if no links are found.

### Conclusion:

Your current solution is correct, but switching to `current.value("$links")` for outgoing links ensures you only get the links from the current file. Additionally, you can easily customize your layout and styling with DatacoreJS since it supports arbitrary HTML, allowing you to design views however you prefer.

Let me know if you need further customization or clarification!



### Key Features:

- **Filter Box**: Allows users to input a string to filter the rows based on matching content.
- **Sortable Columns**: Clicking on the table header sorts the data based on that column, supporting both ascending and descending sorting.
- **React State Management**: Utilizes `dc.useState` to manage sorting and filtering states.
- **Memoization with `dc.useMemo()`**: Ensures that filtering and sorting are recomputed only when necessary, improving performance.

### Full Code Example

```jsx
datacorejsx
// Config header and also query string here.
// Support sort and also filter box.
const query = `@page and path("Test datacore")`;
const columns_array = [
    { title: "Link", value: "$link" },
    { title: "Name", value: "name" },
    { title: "When", value: "when" },
    { title: "Test", value: "test" },
    { title: "File", value: "file" }
];

function View() {
    // Fetching data using Datacore query
    const games = dc.useQuery(query);

    // React state for sorting and filtering
    const [sortConfig, setSortConfig] = dc.useState({ key: null, direction: 'asc' });
    const [filter, setFilter] = dc.useState("");

    // Define table columns with sorting functionality
    const columns = columns_array.map((c) => {
        return c.value.startsWith('$') 
            ? { title: () => <span onClick={() => handleSort(c.value)}>{c.title}{getSortIndicator(c.value)}</span>, value: (game) => game[c.value] }
            : { title: () => <span onClick={() => handleSort(c.value)}>{c.title}{getSortIndicator(c.value)}</span>, value: (game) => game.value(c.value) };
    });

    // Memoized filtering and sorting logic
    const filteredAndSortedGames = dc.useMemo(() => {
        let filtered = games;

        // Filtering logic based on input
        if (filter) {
            filtered = games.filter((game) => {
                return Object.keys(game.$frontmatter).some((key) => {
                    return key.includes(filter) || game.$frontmatter[key].raw.toString().includes(filter);
                }) || game.$file.includes(filter);
            });
        }

        // Sorting logic based on column header clicks
        if (sortConfig.key) {
            filtered = filtered.sort((a, b) => {
                const aValue = sortConfig.key.startsWith('$') ? a[sortConfig.key] : a.value(sortConfig.key);
                const bValue = sortConfig.key.startsWith('$') ? b[sortConfig.key] : b.value(sortConfig.key);
                if (typeof aValue === 'string' && typeof bValue === 'string') {
                    return sortConfig.direction === 'asc' ? aValue.localeCompare(bValue) : bValue.localeCompare(aValue);
                }
                return sortConfig.direction === 'asc' ? aValue - bValue : bValue - aValue;
            });
        }

        return filtered;
    }, [games, filter, sortConfig]);

    // Handle search input for filtering
    const handleSearch = (inputEvent) => {
        setFilter(inputEvent.target.value);
    };

    // Handle sorting when clicking the table headers
    const handleSort = (key) => {
        let direction = 'asc';
        if (sortConfig.key === key && sortConfig.direction === 'asc') {
            direction = 'desc';
        }
        setSortConfig({ key, direction });
    };

    // Display the sorting direction indicator (up/down arrow)
    const getSortIndicator = (key) => {
        if (sortConfig.key === key) {
            return sortConfig.direction === 'asc' ? ' ↑' : ' ↓';
        }
        return '';
    };

    return (
        <>
            {/* Filter input box */}
            <dc.Group justify="end">
                <input onChange={handleSearch} placeholder="Search..." />
            </dc.Group>
            
            {/* Display table with sorted/filtered data */}
            <dc.VanillaTable columns={columns} rows={filteredAndSortedGames} />
        </>
    );
}

// Return the main View component to render the table
return <View />;
```

### How It Works:

1. **Query Setup**:
    
    - The `query` variable defines which data to fetch. In this case, it retrieves pages within the path `"Test datacore"` using Datacore’s query system.
2. **Columns Definition**:
    
    - `columns_array` contains the configuration for the table columns, each with a `title` (displayed in the header) and a `value` (corresponding to the data field to render).
    - The `value` checks if it’s a system field (like `$link`) or a custom field (like `name` or `test`), and retrieves the respective value for display.
3. **State Management**:
    
    - `sortConfig` holds the current column and direction for sorting (`asc` or `desc`).
    - `filter` stores the user input from the search bar, allowing filtering based on text input.
4. **Filtering and Sorting**:
    
    - **Filtering**: If the `filter` is active, it filters the rows based on matching text in any of the frontmatter or file name fields.
    - **Sorting**: When the user clicks on a table header, it toggles between ascending (`asc`) and descending (`desc`) sorting for that column. Sorting works for both string and number values.
    - The `dc.useMemo()` hook is used to ensure that sorting and filtering are only recomputed when the `games`, `filter`, or `sortConfig` values change. This improves performance.
5. **Rendering**:
    
    - The `dc.Group` is used to align the search input to the right.
    - `dc.VanillaTable` renders the table with the defined columns and rows (the filtered and sorted list of games).

### Key Concepts to Learn:

- **React**: This entire example is built using **React** principles such as components, state management with `useState`, and effects with `useMemo`. These concepts are crucial for creating interactive UIs.
- **JSX**: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension of JavaScript, allowing you to write HTML-like elements directly in JavaScript. You’ll need to get familiar with JSX syntax to build custom views.
- **DatacoreJS**: This system integrates with React and Obsidian’s data backend, offering custom hooks like `dc.useQuery`, `dc.useState`, and `dc.useMemo` to handle state and queries efficiently.

### Additional Improvements:

1. **Avoid Re-Rendering**: By using `dc.useMemo()`, you ensure that the filtering and sorting logic only recalculates when necessary, making the UI more efficient.
2. **Advanced Customization**: With DatacoreJS, you can further customize the table, perhaps by adding pagination, dynamic column management, or more complex filters.

---

By learning **React**, **JSX**, and **DatacoreJS**, you'll be able to build increasingly complex interactive components for your vault. React’s component-based architecture allows for extensibility, and with DatacoreJS’s rich querying capabilities, you can create sophisticated data views inside Obsidian.





It seems like you're discussing features for a plugin or framework you're developing in Obsidian (possibly using DataviewJS or Datacore), which focuses on enhancing user interfaces like tables and lists, adding components like select elements, and improving user interaction with metadata. Let's break down the ideas and concepts you're working with and address each one.

### 1. **Exposing Obsidian's Core Functions**:

- **Notice and setIcon**:
    
    - `Notice`: This function likely shows notification messages in Obsidian.
    - `setIcon`: This function attaches an icon (like Lucide icons) to an HTML element, making your UI visually consistent with the rest of Obsidian. The example `setIcon(htmlelment, 'x')` attaches the "x" icon to the element.
- **Possible Implementation**:
    
    - If you want to expose these functions for your users or developers, you can create utility wrappers in your plugin that allows calling `setIcon()` in their custom components.
    
    **Example**:
    
```jsx
// Utility to set an icon on an element
function setIcon(element, iconName) {
  // Assuming Obsidian provides the icon library and mechanism to attach them
  element.setAttribute('data-icon', iconName);
  // If using Lucide or similar, you may also need to inject the SVG path
  element.innerHTML = lucideIcons[iconName]; // assuming lucideIcons is an available library
}

// Usage example in JSX
const IconComponent = ({ icon }) => {
  const ref = useRef(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    setIcon(ref.current, icon);
  }, [icon]);

  return <div ref={ref}></div>;
};

// Rendering in React
<IconComponent icon="x" />
```
    
    This approach makes it easy to add icons dynamically in React components.
    

### 2. **JSX and React Learning Curve**:

- You mentioned JSX being intuitive after a few examples. JSX, a syntax extension for React, closely resembles HTML and allows you to create component-based UIs easily. It's powerful for templating UIs in Obsidian plugins, as it gives you the flexibility to use HTML-like structures with the dynamism of JavaScript.
    
- **Suggestion**: When creating React components for Obsidian, it's good practice to provide simple examples in the documentation to ease developers into JSX. You can also document the most common use cases like rendering icons, tables, and metadata views using JSX.
    

### 3. **Select Components**:

- You're building a select component (dropdown) that integrates with the dynamic data from Obsidian's vault.
    
- **Initial Approach**:
    
    - Start with a **basic HTML select element** for simplicity.
    - Enhance it with libraries like **Popper.js** or **floating-ui** if more customization is required.
    
    **Basic HTML Select Example**:
    
 ```jsx
 const SelectComponent = ({ options, onChange }) => {
  return (
    <select onChange={onChange}>
      {options.map((option, index) => (
        <option key={index} value={option.value}>
          {option.label}
        </option>
      ))}
    </select>
  );
};

// Usage
const options = [
  { value: 'project1', label: 'Project 1' },
  { value: 'project2', label: 'Project 2' },
];

<SelectComponent options={options} onChange={(e) => handleProjectChange(e.target.value)} />
```
    
- **Advanced Options**:
    
    - You can later add support for more complex dropdowns using `Popper.js` or `floating-ui` for positioning and interaction. This would allow for more custom styling and behavior beyond standard HTML selects.

### 4. **Enhanced Table Views**:

- **Adding Entities to Existing Tables**: This feature allows users to add tasks or other entries directly to tables and have them inherit properties (e.g., auto-filling the "Project" field when adding a task to a specific project table).
    
- **Plan**:
    
    - When users add a new entry (task), pre-fill certain fields based on the context or filters applied to the table. For instance, if a task is added to the "Project 1" table, it should auto-assign `Project: [[Project 1]]` as a property.
    
    **Example**:
    
 ```jsx
function addTaskToTable(projectName) {
  const newTask = {
    name: "New Task",
    project: projectName,
    dueDate: null,
  };
  // Add to data and refresh the table
}
```
    
- **Inline Editing for Tables**:
    
    - Inline editing for metadata properties within the table is a powerful feature, allowing users to modify data like project names or due dates directly without navigating to the file.
    
    **Example**:
    
```jsx
const EditableCell = ({ value, onChange }) => {
  return <input type="text" value={value} onChange={(e) => onChange(e.target.value)} />;
};
```
    

### 5. **Recurring Tasks and Metadata for Text Blocks**:

- **Recurring Tasks**: Implementing a recurring task mechanism (e.g., auto-resetting checkboxes) is slightly beyond the scope of Datacore, but it could be implemented using custom logic.
    
    **Example**:
    
```
if (taskIsCompleted) {
  updateTask({ ...task, completed: false, dueDate: nextDueDate });
}
```
    
- **Metadata for Text Blocks**: Allowing users to add metadata to individual text blocks within a file (e.g., tagging quotes with authors) is useful for querying and displaying information without requiring each block to be a separate file.
    
- **Plan**:
    
    - You could implement a lightweight metadata syntax (similar to YAML front matter) that can be embedded in text blocks. Then, Datacore or DataviewJS can query based on these metadata entries.
    
    **Example**:
    
```
> "The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today."
- Author: Franklin D. Roosevelt
```
    

### 6. **Interactive Checkboxes**:

- Interactive checkboxes in Datacore views (similar to Dataview) can allow users to toggle tasks or states directly within the view.
    
    **Plan**:
    
    - Enable checkboxes to not only toggle tasks but also trigger other actions (e.g., update metadata or change status).
    
    **Example**:
    
```jsx
const CheckboxComponent = ({ checked, onChange }) => {
  return <input type="checkbox" checked={checked} onChange={onChange} />;
};
```
    

### 7. **Documentation for Your Project**:

- Building a documentation website is a great next step. You can use **Gatsby** or **Docusaurus** to generate modern, responsive documentation that developers can easily navigate.

**Considerations**:

- Provide example use cases for each component or function.
- Add a section for common workflows like adding new tasks or editing metadata directly from tables.

**Suggested Structure**:

- **Overview**: Explains the plugin and key features.
- **Components**: Documents how to use `IconComponent`, `SelectComponent`, table views, etc.
- **Workflows**: Example workflows like adding tasks, recurring tasks, and inline metadata editing.
- **Advanced Topics**: Popper.js integration, advanced table features, etc.

---

These ideas aim to improve user workflows by making table views interactive, providing select components, and enabling dynamic metadata handling. With well-documented examples and intuitive components, developers with minimal React experience can still build powerful interfaces in Obsidian.





### 1. **Task Text as a Field in Task Objects**

You mentioned that the tasks in your current setup don't have the task text as a field. This could be due to how tasks are being parsed or stored in your Datacore or Obsidian environment. Typically, tasks should have a field that stores the text content. If that’s missing, it may be a parsing issue, a version mismatch, or a bug.

#### Steps to Debug:

- **Verify Object Structure**: Check the structure of your task objects using `console.log(current.$sections)` or a similar debug statement in your code to inspect whether task text is stored under another field name or missing entirely.
    
- **Obsidian Parsing**: The way tasks are parsed from Markdown might be missing the task text field, especially if you’re using custom plugins or views that interact with task metadata. Make sure that the task text is being pulled from the appropriate field in the Markdown file. The task text is typically a part of the task block’s metadata.
    
- **Fallback**: If the task text is completely missing from your object, consider constructing it from the task's structure or querying the Markdown block directly.
    

#### Possible Fix:

```jsx
// Example: checking for task text field in the task objects
const allTasks = current.$sections
  .filter(s => s.$title === "Status Tasks")
  .map(s => s.$blocks)
  .flat()
  .filter(b => b.$type === "list")
  .map(l => l.$elements)
  .flat()
  .map(t => t.$text || t.$content || ""); // Look for text field in the task object
```


If `$text` is not present, try to check whether a different field like `$content` holds the task text.

### 2. **Filtering Current Node Elements in `dc.useQuery()`**

It seems that you're trying to query only the tasks for the current file/path using `dc.useQuery()`. The queries you tried were close, but the filtering based on the current path might not be working due to how paths are handled in the query system.

Here’s how you can query tasks for the current file:

```jsx
const current = dc.useCurrentFile();
const tasks = dc.useQuery(`@task and path = '${current.$path}'`);
```

If this doesn’t work, the issue might be due to how paths are structured in your vault, or how the query syntax interprets paths. Double-check that `current.$path` is returning the correct value by logging it out:

```jsx
console.log(current.$path);
```

If the path is returned as expected but filtering still doesn’t work, it may be due to how the query system is matching the path field. In that case, using `dc.useCurrentFile()` as your filter base could be a more reliable approach.

### 3. **Accessing Section or Header Name**

You noted that the section/header name is missing for both `_markdownListBlock` and `_MarkdownTaskItem`. To retrieve the section name, yes, you would need to traverse up the parent hierarchy until you reach a `_MarkdownSection` object.

#### Approach:

- Traverse the parent field manually, as you suggested.
- Currently, if there's no built-in support to directly include the section name in `dc.useQuery()`, you'll have to implement it manually by navigating through the parent chain.

#### Example Code:

```jsx
const allTasks = current.$sections
  .filter(s => s.$title === "Status Tasks")
  .map(s => ({
    title: s.$title,
    tasks: s.$blocks.filter(b => b.$type === "list").map(l => l.$elements).flat(),
  }));
```

This will group tasks by their sections, which gives you a reference to the section title.

### 4. **Displaying List of Pages Using `dc.useQuery()`**

You’re trying to display a list of pages in a specific folder using `dc.useQuery()`. The issue is that when using the `query()` method, the results are returned as plain text links (like `[[filename]]`).

Here’s a better way to query and display the results:

#### Correct Query:

jsx

Copy code

```jsx
return function View() {
  const pages = dc.useQuery(`@page and path("§Periodic Notes/Daily")`);
  
  return (
    <ul>
      {pages.map(page => (
        <li key={page.$file}>
          <a href={page.$file}> {page.$file} </a>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

In this code:

- You are now correctly using `dc.useQuery()` to fetch pages from the `Daily` folder.
- The results are displayed as clickable links, which is achieved by wrapping the filenames in an anchor (`<a>` tag). In Obsidian, you can often use `href={page.$file}` to link to a file.

### 5. **Inline Queries**

You mentioned wanting to run the query as an inline query. While inline queries might not be fully supported yet in the context you're working with, a possible workaround is to use a `View` function to simulate inline functionality and render the output within a span or div. Here's an example:

```jsx
return function InlineView() {
  const current = dc.useCurrentFile();
  const tasks = dc.useQuery(`@task and path = '${current.$path}'`);
  const completedTasks = tasks.filter(task => task.$completed).length;

  return (
    <span>
      {completedTasks}/{tasks.length} tasks completed
    </span>
  );
}
```

This isn't exactly "inline" in the markdown sense, but you can render the result in place within your React component.

### 6. **Mobile Issues with Datacore**

You mentioned issues with Datacore on mobile. It’s worth checking whether Datacore is properly installed and activated through BRAT (Beta Reviewers Auto-update Tester) on your mobile device. Mobile environments might not fully support all the functionality available on desktop, so ensure you’re testing the plugin in a compatible environment.

- Double-check installation settings.
- Confirm mobile support with the plugin developers if necessary.

### Conclusion

To summarize:

1. **Task Text Missing**: Debug the structure of task objects to verify if the task text is stored correctly.
2. **Path Query Issues**: Make sure `current.$path` is returning the expected value and query the path correctly in `dc.useQuery()`.
3. **Section Name Access**: Yes, traverse the parent chain to access the section name, as it’s not included directly.
4. **Displaying List of Pages**: Use `dc.useQuery()` and render the results as clickable links in an `<ul>` list.
5. **Inline Queries**: Inline queries aren’t fully supported yet, but you can work around this by rendering results in a React component.
6. **Mobile Issues**: Ensure Datacore is installed and activated properly on mobile.

By implementing these solutions, you should be able to effectively manage tasks, queries, and UI elements in your Obsidian environment.








It sounds like you’re working through an issue related to using `dc.require` to load a JavaScript file in a system or plugin (like Datacore) that you're using. Here’s a breakdown of what’s happening and a potential solution based on the error and context.

### The Problem

- **Error 1**:  
    When you try to load the `.js` file using `dc.headerLink("scripts/datacore.js")`, you get the error:

```typescript
Error: .parse must be called with a string or Buffer as its argument
```
    
    This error suggests that `.parse` is being called on something that isn't a string or buffer. It indicates that the system is likely expecting a different input format, possibly YAML frontmatter or markdown, which isn’t found in a `.js` file.
    
- **Error 2**:  
    When you remove the `headerLink` part and simply use:
    
```js
const View = await dc.require("scripts/datacore.js");
```
    
    You get the following error:
    
```lua
Error: Could not find a script at the given path: scripts/datacore.js
```
    
    This indicates that the system can’t locate the `.js` file at the specified path.
    

### Explanation and Solution

#### Issue with `dc.headerLink`

`dc.headerLink` appears to be a method designed to handle Markdown files or files with YAML frontmatter, and it's not suitable for raw JavaScript files. When you pass a `.js` file to `headerLink`, it tries to parse it as though it’s a text file with some metadata, hence the `.parse` error.

#### Using `dc.require` Directly

The proper approach seems to be using `dc.require` to load the `.js` file directly, but you're running into an issue with the file not being found. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. **Path Resolution**:  
    Make sure that the file `scripts/datacore.js` exists relative to the location where the `dc.require` command is being run. Verify that the path is correct.
    
2. **File Indexing**:  
    From the last messages, it seems that there was a bug with JavaScript files not showing up in the Datacore index, but it’s fixed in version `0.1.14`. Make sure you are using the updated version (`0.1.14` or higher) that fixes the issue with `dc.require`.
    

### Final Solution

1. **Ensure you're on the latest version (0.1.14 or higher)**:

```sql
npm update datacore-plugin --save
```
    
    or the equivalent for your package manager.
    
2. **Use the corrected syntax**: Since `dc.headerLink` is not needed for JavaScript files, use:
    
```jsx
const View = await dc.require("scripts/datacore.js");
return View(dc);c);
````
    
    If you’re still getting the error `Could not find a script`, verify the path to `scripts/datacore.js` and ensure it exists in the expected location.
    
3. **Verify file location**:  
    Check that `scripts/datacore.js` is in the correct directory, and that there are no typos or discrepancies in the path.
    

### In Summary

- The issue is likely resolved by updating to version `0.1.14` or higher, where the bug with `.js` files in the Datacore index was fixed.
- The proper syntax for requiring a JavaScript file is:
    
```jsx
const View = await dc.require("scripts/datacore.js");
return View(dc);
```
    
- Make sure the `.js` file is in the correct path relative to where your code is running.




Here’s a more polished and structured version of the conversation, taking into account all the previous context and interactions:

---

### Initial Question

**User**:  
Hey everyone, I just wanted to ask a question about pagination. It's been checked off on the roadmap, but when I created a vanilla table with over 100 records, it didn't break off at 50. Is it not available yet, or am I missing something?

**Response**:  
I haven’t figured it out either. I gave up because my table kept freezing in Obsidian. I might try again today though.

```jsx
<dc.VanillaTable groupings={GROUPINGS} columns={COLUMNS} rows={grouped} paging={12} />
```

---

### Nested Fields Question

**User**:  
Another question: Do I have to map fields when they’re nested in order to access them?

**Response**:  
It depends on how they are nested and what you want to get out of them.

**User**:  
Okay, I’m about to start playing with the console and the `extractFields` function to see how they qualify.

**Response**:  
Have fun! I might not be of much help with that.

**User**:  
Thank you so much!

---

### YAML and Query Question

**User**:  
I’ve got two more questions:

1. I’m having trouble getting a query like `dc.useQuery("@page and #game and rating >= 8")` to work. The table shows no results, even though my notes have a YAML property called `rating`.
2. How do I sort based on multiple properties? For example, sort by priority first, and then by date? (Sorry if it's a dumb question, I'm still learning JavaScript.)

**Response**:  
Where is the YAML defined? Is it in the frontmatter?

**User**:  
Yes, it’s in the frontmatter.

**Response**:  
If it's in the frontmatter, you need to use `$frontmatter.rating >= 8` instead of `rating >= 8`.

### Sorting by Multiple Properties

**User**:  
Oooh, I see! Thanks for that, I appreciate it.  
But what about sorting by multiple properties?

**Response**:  
If you're only sorting by two properties, you can wrap `useQuery` in a `DataArray` and group the results like this:

```jsx
dc.array(dc.useQuery(...)).groupBy(...).sort(...)
```

It might be possible to display deeply nested groups in a table, but don't quote me on that.

**User**:  
Fantastic, that works—thank you!

**Response**:  
Actually, you don’t need to `groupBy` to sort by multiple properties. You can just pass an array into the `sort` function, like this:

```jsx
const raw = dc.useQuery("blah and blah");
const sorted = dc.useArray(raw, array => {
  return array.sort(element => [element.$name, element.value("rating")]);
});
```

This query should work as-is. The reason it doesn’t currently is a bug, which will be fixed in the next beta release.

**User**:  
I see, got it. Thanks for the info!

### Sorting with Different Orders (Ascending and Descending)

**User**:  
What if I want one field in ascending order and another in descending order?

**Response**:  
If one of the fields is numeric, you can just negate it. Otherwise, you might need a custom comparator. Here’s an example:

```jsx
const raw = dc.useQuery("blah and blah");
const sorted = dc.useArray(raw, array => {
  return array.sort(
    element => element,
    undefined,
    (first, second) => {
      // Sort the first field in ascending order.
      const keyOne = array.defaultComparator(first.$blah, second.$blah);
      if (keyOne !== 0) return keyOne;

      // Sort the second field in descending order.
      const keyTwo = array.defaultComparator(first.$foo, second.$foo);
      return -keyTwo;
    }
  );
});
```

**User**:  
I see! Thanks for all the help.

**Response**:  
No problem! This custom comparator example should scale to any number of properties.

### Final Thanks

**User**:  
That’s perfect, thanks so much—I really appreciate all the help!

### Summary

- **Pagination**: Check if pagination is correctly implemented via the `paging` prop in `VanillaTable`.
- **Nested Fields**: You may need to extract fields depending on their nesting structure.
- **Querying YAML**: Use `$frontmatter` when querying YAML frontmatter fields.
- **Sorting Multiple Fields**: Use arrays in `sort` functions and custom comparators to handle complex sorting.





It sounds like you're working on dynamically creating a table in a JavaScript-based environment (like React) with data coming from frontmatter fields in Obsidian, and you're trying to display nested YAML fields in a table format using a query.

I'll walk through your approach and how you can fine-tune it to get the behavior you want. Your issue seems to stem from dynamically accessing deeply nested properties and dynamically generating table columns for your data. Let me break down the key elements, starting with the core issues and then refining the solution.

### 1. **Dynamic Access to Nested Properties**

When you're accessing properties like `mathLink-blocks.AltNotation` within your objects, it's essential to use the correct syntax when dynamically adding columns. JavaScript’s bracket notation allows for dynamic key access, but in some cases, you might have to adjust it for complex objects.

In your case, accessing `mathLink-blocks` like this:

```js
file.value("mathLink-blocks")[name]
```

is the right approach for dynamically accessing nested fields.

### 2. **Dynamic Column Generation**

You've automated the generation of columns using a loop. Here’s an improved version of your code that ensures you dynamically create columns based on the keys inside the `mathLink-blocks` object and handles nested fields:

```jsx
let COLUMNS = [
    { id: "File", value: (file) => file.$link } // Initial column for File
];

function addColumns(fields) {
    // Assume 'fields' is an array of objects from 'mathLink-blocks'
    const fieldKeys = Object.keys(fields[0]); // Get keys from the first object
    fieldKeys.forEach((key) => {
        COLUMNS.push({
            id: key,
            value: (file) => file.value("mathLink-blocks")[key] // Access dynamically
        });
    });
}

return function View() {
    const qdata = dc.useQuery(`@page and path("Glossary/Variables")`);
    
    if (qdata.length > 0) {
        // Dynamically add columns based on the first file's 'mathLink-blocks'
        addColumns(qdata.map(file => file.value("mathLink-blocks")));
    }

    return (
        <dc.VanillaTable columns={COLUMNS} rows={qdata} paging={20} />
    );
}
```

### 3. **Adding Scrollbars for Wide Tables**

If you're dealing with tables that have too many columns to fit in the viewport, you can easily add a horizontal scrollbar by applying CSS. Here’s how you can do it:

```css
.dc-table-container {
    overflow-x: scroll;
}
```

In your component, wrap the table in a div with this class:

```jsx
return function View() {
    const qdata = dc.useQuery(`@page and path("Glossary/Variables")`);
    
    if (qdata.length > 0) {
        addColumns(qdata.map(file => file.value("mathLink-blocks")));
    }

    return (
        <div className="dc-table-container">
            <dc.VanillaTable columns={COLUMNS} rows={qdata} paging={20} />
        </div>
    );
}
```

This will make sure that if the table overflows horizontally, a scrollbar will appear.

### 4. **Understanding Query Behavior**

You mentioned some queries not returning the results you expect. This is often caused by either the incorrect path or the query format. If you're working with `datacore`, ensure your query paths are correct.

Here’s an example query that should work:
```js
const qdata = dc.useQuery(`@page and path("Glossary/Variables")`);
```

If this fails, it might be due to how your paths are structured in Obsidian. Ensure that `Variables` exists under the `Glossary` folder and that the metadata you're querying actually matches the frontmatter format.

### 5. **Handling Readable Line Length and Tables**

If you’re facing issues with tables becoming too small because of the "readable line length" setting, you can control how your table is displayed by either forcing a minimum width or allowing it to break free of the layout constraints.

For instance, you could use something like this in your CSS:

```css
.dc-table-container {
    overflow-x: auto;
    min-width: 100%;
}
```

This ensures the table will not shrink beyond a readable size, while also allowing scrolling.

### Summary:

1. **Dynamic Access**: You've correctly used `file.value("mathLink-blocks")[name]` for accessing fields dynamically.
2. **Column Generation**: The loop that dynamically adds columns should now work correctly, ensuring it handles all keys from `mathLink-blocks`.
3. **Scrollbar**: For large tables, adding `overflow-x: scroll` should solve the issue of wide tables.
4. **Query Issues**: Make sure you're using the correct path in your `useQuery`, and that your folder structure matches the path.

### Inline Queries and JSX Query Language in Datacore

The shift from Dataview to Datacore introduces some differences in how queries are written, especially for inline queries and dynamic elements using JSX. While Dataview’s inline queries work in edit mode but often break in read mode, Datacore’s JSX allows more flexibility. Let's walk through the steps for writing inline queries, list rendering, querying by dates, and linking customization.

#### 1. **Rendering a Table of Files in a Folder with JSX Query Language**

Your initial example shows how to query files in a folder and render them in a table. This is a good starting point for understanding how Datacore works:

```jsx
const COLUMNS = [
    { id: "File", value: (file) => file.$link }
];

return function View() {
    const qdata = dc.useQuery(`@page and path("folder name")`); // Query files in the folder

    return (
        <dc.VanillaTable columns={COLUMNS} rows={qdata} />
    );
}
```

In this example:

- `dc.useQuery()` fetches the pages within the specified folder.
- `dc.VanillaTable` is used to render the result as a table, and each row is dynamically populated with the file link (`file.$link`).

#### 2. **Rendering a Bullet List Instead of a Table**

If you prefer to render a bullet list of files instead of a table, you can use the `map()` function to generate the list:

```jsx
return dc.api.query('@page and path("folder name")').map(file => `- ${file.$link}`);
```

This generates a list of files in the specified folder, formatted as a Markdown bullet list with links.

#### 3. **Dynamic Queries Based on Tags or Metadata**

You can modify your query to filter based on other metadata fields, such as tags:

```jsx
const COLUMNS = [
    { id: "File", value: (file) => file.$link },
    { id: "Tags", value: (file) => file.$tags } // Add a column for tags
];

return function View() {
    const qdata = dc.useQuery(`@page and #your-tag`); // Query based on a tag

    return (
        <dc.VanillaTable columns={COLUMNS} rows={qdata} />
    );
}
```

In this case, we are querying all pages that have a specific tag, and the table will display both the file link and its tags.

#### 4. **Date-Based Queries and Filtering**

To filter results based on date, you can use a date comparison directly in the query string. If you're trying to filter by a specific date field in your frontmatter, you can write the query like this:

```jsx
const qdata = dc.useQuery(`@page and time > date(2024-10-10)`); // Filter files based on the time field
```

For more complex filtering using JavaScript, you can manually filter the query results after fetching them:

```jsx
const qdata = dc.useQuery(`@page`);
const filtered = dc.useArray(qdata, array => 
    array.filter(item => new Date(item.value("time")) > new Date("2024-10-10"))
);
```

In this case, we manually filter the results by converting the `time` field to a JavaScript `Date` object and comparing it with the target date.

#### 5. **Rendering Links with Custom HTML**

If you want to render a link using custom HTML, you can leverage JSX, but remember that JSX is not pure HTML. However, you can directly render internal links like this:

```jsx
<a class="internal-link" data-href={file.$path}>{file.$name}</a>
````

Alternatively, you can use the Datacore `dc.Link` component, which automatically handles internal links:

```jsx
<dc.Link link={file.$link} />
```

This allows for cleaner integration and ensures that the internal link is rendered correctly.

#### 6. **Handling Date Libraries and Comparisons**

Datacore includes the `luxon` date library for working with dates and times. Here’s how you can use `luxon` to filter by date:

```jsx
const { DateTime } = dc.luxon;
const qdata = dc.useQuery(`@page`);

const filtered = qdata.filter(file => 
    DateTime.fromISO(file.value("time")).toMillis() > DateTime.now().toMillis()
);
```

This example compares the `time` field from the frontmatter using `luxon`’s `DateTime` class, which makes it easier to handle complex date manipulations.

#### 7. **Documentation for Datacore API**

Currently, Datacore documentation is still in development, so exploring the source code or examples is the best way to learn. However, there are common components such as:

- `dc.useQuery()`: Fetches data based on a query.
- `dc.VanillaTable()`: Renders a table based on columns and rows.
- `dc.api.query()`: Directly fetches data for custom handling.

Additional APIs like `dc.Link()` for rendering links or `dc.useArray()` for more complex data manipulations are also available.

### Conclusion

Datacore offers flexible querying and rendering capabilities with JSX, and understanding its components allows you to perform dynamic queries for lists, tables, and more complex data manipulations. The examples above should help you work with folder queries, tag filtering, date comparisons, and custom link rendering.

If you encounter further issues with queries or rendering, feel free to ask for more detailed explanations.







It sounds like you're looking for a way to edit fields within a **Datacore query or table** directly, similar to how a plugin like **Metadata Menu** allows inline editing of frontmatter in Obsidian. Additionally, you’re interested in querying `@block` elements within specific sections, handling list items with specific text, and parsing dates using custom formats in queries.

Let me break down these points one by one, starting with the concept of **editable fields** and moving through your other inquiries.

### 1. **Editable Fields in Datacore Queries or Tables**

Datacore itself does not natively support inline editing of frontmatter directly through the queries or tables displayed, but this feature could potentially be implemented in future releases or through custom integration. Currently, to achieve something like this, you could integrate **Metadata Menu** or a similar plugin with Datacore, if feasible, by handling metadata updates externally.

For now, here’s an example flow:

- **Datacore Query**: Use Datacore to display the metadata (like a table or list).
- **External Edit**: Use something like **Metadata Menu** to provide frontmatter editing functionality on the same data.
- **Update**: After editing, re-run or refresh the Datacore query to show updated values.

Example for rendering metadata (but not editing it directly):

```jsx
const COLUMNS = [
    { id: "File", value: (file) => file.$link },
    { id: "Title", value: (file) => file.title },
    { id: "Tags", value: (file) => file.$tags }
];

return function View() {
    const qdata = dc.useQuery(`@page and path("folder")`);
    return (
        <dc.VanillaTable columns={COLUMNS} rows={qdata} paging={20} />
    );
}
```

To **make fields editable**, you would need a feature that opens the file for inline frontmatter editing, possibly linked to buttons in the table. This would need additional scripting or a plugin that manages metadata updates.

### 2. **Querying `@block` Inside a Specific `@section`**

You can query specific blocks inside sections by combining `@block` with a condition that identifies the parent `@section`. Here's an example query:

```jsx
dc.useQuery('@block and childof(@section and $title = "section_name")');
```

This query will find all blocks that are children of a section named `"section_name"`. The `childof()` function ensures that only blocks under the specified section are returned.

### 3. **Query List Items Containing Specific Text**

To query list items that contain specific text, you could use something like the following (in a future version, once `$text` is available as a property):

```jsx
const qdata = dc.useQuery(`@list and contains($text, "specific text")`);
```

This would filter the list items to return only those that contain the given text. Right now, though, you’ll need to wait for a release where `$text` is available for querying directly.

### 4. **Custom Date Parsing with Luxon in Queries**

To parse dates with a custom format inside a query, you would typically do this after fetching the results rather than inside the query itself. You can process the dates using **Luxon** after pulling the data.

Here’s an example of using `Luxon` to parse a custom date format from frontmatter after a query:

```jsx
const { DateTime } = dc.luxon;

return function View() {
    const qdata = dc.useQuery(`@page`);
    
    const formattedData = qdata.map(file => {
        const rawDate = file.value("date"); // Assuming "date" is the field
        const parsedDate = DateTime.fromFormat(rawDate, "DDD"); // Custom format
        return {
            ...file,
            parsedDate
        };
    });

    return (
        <dc.VanillaTable columns={[ 
            { id: "File", value: (file) => file.$link }, 
            { id: "Date", value: (file) => file.parsedDate.toFormat("yyyy-MM-dd") } 
        ]} rows={formattedData} />
    );
}
```

In this example:

- The `DateTime.fromFormat(rawDate, "DDD")` function is used to parse the raw date string using the custom format `DDD` (day of the year).
- The table then displays the parsed date in a more readable format.

### Summary

- **Editable Fields**: Inline editing of fields in Datacore is not currently available. You’d need to integrate a plugin like **Metadata Menu** for that functionality.
- **Querying Blocks in Sections**: You can query blocks that are children of specific sections using `childof(@section)`.
- **Querying List Items**: A feature allowing the querying of list items by text content will be available in a future release.
- **Custom Date Parsing**: Use **Luxon** to parse dates after querying, allowing for custom formats and manipulations.

If Datacore updates with new features (like inline editable fields or `$text` support), this functionality will be smoother.
