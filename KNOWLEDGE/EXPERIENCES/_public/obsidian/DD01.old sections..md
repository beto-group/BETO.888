### 1. **System Architecture and Core Functionalities**

This category focuses on the foundational systems, planned features, and key challenges the Datacore project aims to address.

#### 1.1. **Datacore System Overview**

- **Purpose**: Datacore functions as a **document query engine** with a specialized focus on **block-level querying**. It features a built-in caching system for fast document retrieval​.
- **Target Audience**: Power users familiar with JavaScript, JSX, and TypeScript can leverage the **DatacoreJS API** to build custom views. The system also strives for user-friendliness by progressively introducing **low-code tools**​​.
- **Main Challenges**:
    - **Editable Components**: The ability to create editable components within Datacore using a `Field` abstraction for metadata updates is under development​.
    - **Performance Issues**: Notably, the initial indexing phase is slow compared to other systems like Dataview. Proposed optimizations include **WebAssembly (WASM)** for multithreading, **SharedArrayBuffer**, and improved task scheduling​.
    - **Query Language Improvements**: Efforts are focused on refining the **Datacore Query Language (DQL)** to include advanced query syntax (e.g., `$`-prefixed fields, boolean operations)​​.

#### 1.2. **Custom Rendering and Block-Level Search**

- **Game Data Display**: Custom columns and groupings, such as year-based groupings, provide a refined data display​.
- **Rendering Enhancements**: The rendering system supports **tagged blocks**, allowing users to embed content based on block IDs. This enhances modularity and reuse of document sections​.
- **Interactive Views**: The system provides **interactive filtering** and **sorting** based on parameters like "time played" and game tags. These views aim to simplify the representation of large data sets within the UI​.
- **Pre-Built Views**: Planned features include **galleries, card views, and chart views** designed to reduce external dependencies like D3.js​.

#### 1.3. **Complex Querying and Data Manipulation**

- **Dynamic Schema for Nested Structures**: Recursive functions allow the system to handle **nested YAML frontmatter**, enabling complex queries​.
- **Task Sorting and Filtering**: Complex query conditions (e.g., sorting tasks by `status` and `due date`) allow for more flexible and dynamic data manipulation​.
- **Performance Optimizations**: The query engine optimizes post-query processes, minimizing unnecessary data loading. This is particularly beneficial when working with large datasets​​.
- **Versioning and Schema Evolution**: The system adapts to **evolving YAML schemas** by introducing schema versioning to manage new data types and structures​.

#### 1.4. **Planned System Features**

- **Low-Code Tools**: Datacore is moving towards supporting **low-code interfaces** to make querying more accessible for non-programmers. This includes a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor​.
- **Editable Fields**: React-based components are being developed to allow for live updates to document fields directly from the UI. This involves embedding mechanisms for inline editing​.
- **Future Work**:
    - Expanding block-level embedding functionality.
    - Performance enhancements using **batch processing** and **WebAssembly**​.

### 2. **User Interaction, Task Management, and UI Enhancements**

This category outlines how Datacore facilitates interaction through task management, dynamic UI components, and user-facing improvements.

#### 2.1. **Task Management and Progress Tracking**

- **Task Progress Calculation**: A recursive function (`tprogress`) allows users to calculate completion percentages for tasks and subtasks, providing hierarchical task management​.
- **Dynamic Task Tables**: Tasks are grouped by projects and displayed in interactive tables. Users can mark tasks as complete, modify statuses, and filter tasks dynamically​​.
- **Kanban-Style Boards**: Datacore introduces task boards where tasks can be visually organized and updated via direct user interaction. This improves workflow management by making task visualization more intuitive​.

#### 2.2. **UI Component Development**

- **Callout Components**: The **Callout** component introduces collapsible content blocks with smooth CSS transitions. This feature is designed to handle large content sets by allowing sections to be dynamically revealed or hidden​.
- **Interactive Tables**: Editable tables feature integrated **checkboxes** and **real-time updates** to metadata (e.g., task completion status), enabling users to interact with data tables directly within the interface​​.
- **Smooth Transitions and Performance**: Memoization of titles and the use of smooth transitions enhance the **user experience** during dynamic content updates. This is especially useful in **task management views**​.

#### 2.3. **Handling Large Data Sets**

- **Efficient Pagination**: Pagination strategies like lazy loading improve the handling of large datasets, avoiding performance bottlenecks when querying and displaying thousands of entries​.
- **Search Filtering**: A dynamic search filter enables users to rapidly filter tasks based on name, status, or other attributes, streamlining large-scale task management​.
- **Lazy Loading**: This technique delays loading large datasets until the user interacts with them, conserving resources and preventing UI slowdowns​.

#### 2.4. **Pre-Built UI Views**

- **Simplified Table Views**: These are inspired by Dataview's structure but offer more customization. They provide a wrapper around the core querying engine for easier table creation, simplifying the UI for non-expert users​.
- **Zettelkasten Lookup**: A custom **Zettelkasten system** enables users to organize and retrieve notes based on the "folgezettel" property, integrating a classic note-taking methodology into the Datacore environment​.

### 3. **Performance, Automation, and Community Contributions**

This category encapsulates performance benchmarks, automation efforts, and areas where the community can contribute.

#### 3.1. **Performance Benchmarks and Improvements**

- **Benchmarking Results**: Tests show that Datacore outperforms both **Native Obsidian API** and **Dataview** by up to 50x, especially when running smart queries that minimize unnecessary data loading​.
- **Device-Specific Performance**: Interestingly, iPads outperformed other devices like Windows and Android, emphasizing the need to optimize the system for multi-platform usage​.
- **IndexedDb Performance**: Slowdowns were noted when using **IndexedDb** for bulk metadata retrieval. Future improvements may involve optimizing transaction management and document indexing​.

#### 3.2. **Automation and Workflow Enhancements**

- **Automated Beta Releases**: The introduction of the **BRAT (Beta Release Authoring Tool)** facilitates automated beta version releases, making it easier for developers to test and iterate​.
- **Daily Summaries and Quotes**: Automation scripts can generate daily summaries or random quotes, offering users an integrated approach to workflow management​.
- **Tracking Schema Versions**: Schema versioning allows the system to adapt to new data structures without requiring constant manual updates​.

#### 3.3. **Community Contributions and Feedback**

- **Documentation Improvements**: Community members can contribute to the documentation, especially to make it more accessible to users with limited coding experience​.
- **Testing and Feedback**: Users without deep technical expertise are encouraged to test beta features, providing valuable feedback that will guide the system’s evolution​.
- **Low-Code Contributions**: Efforts are underway to reduce reliance on JavaScript through **low-code tools** that allow users to interact with the system without needing to write complex queries​.
