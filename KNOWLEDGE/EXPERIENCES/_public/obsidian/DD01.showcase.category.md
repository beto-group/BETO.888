## 1. **Datacore: Callout Component Proposal**

### 1.1. **Context**

- Proposal to add a collapsible callout component to Datacore’s component library.
- Useful for scenarios where large content needs to be hidden or revealed dynamically, such as long lists in tables.

### 1.2. **Global Functionality**

- The **Callout** component supports collapsibility and uses smooth CSS transitions.
- Features include:
    - Collapsing/expanding content.
    - Memoized title for performance.
    - Smooth transitions for better UX.

### 1.3. **Code Breakdown**

- **`CalloutContent` component**:
    - Manages content height based on open/closed state.
    - CSS transitions applied for smooth effects.
- **`Callout` component**:
    - Toggles between open and collapsed states based on user interaction.
    - Memoizes title and manages the collapsible behavior.

### 1.4. **Key Features**

- Collapsible content with smooth transitions.
- Reusable component ideal for long lists or large blocks of content.
- Potential for inclusion in Datacore's component library.

## 2. **Project Management in Datacore: Task Layout Design**

### 2.1. **Context**

- Detailed implementation of task-related features in Datacore.
- Includes task tracking, progress calculation, and grouping for project management.

### 2.2. **Code Breakdown**

#### 2.2.1. **Task Progress Calculation**

- Recursive function `tprogress` to calculate the completion percentage of tasks and subtasks.

#### 2.2.2. **Task Table**

- Displays tasks in a table format, showing task details and progress bars.
- Groups tasks by project.

#### 2.2.3. **Fandom, Type, Master Components**

- Components to group tasks by fandom (categories) and display them hierarchically.

### 2.3. **ProjectView**

- Switch-case structure to display different types of views (master, category, fandom) depending on the task’s structure.

## 3. **Benchmarking Datacore**

### 3.1. **Context**

- Performance comparison between the Native Obsidian API, Dataview, and Datacore.

### 3.2. **Results**

- **Datacore** consistently outperforms both the Native API and Dataview, with Datacore being up to 50x faster on average.
- Performance differences across devices: Windows, Android, iPad.

### 3.3. **Insights**

- **Smart Query Execution**: Datacore minimizes unnecessary data loading, optimizing performance.
- **Device-specific performance**: iPad showed the best performance across all methods.

## 4. **Simplified Table Views and Zettelkasten Lookup**

### 4.1. **Simplified Table View**

- A wrapper for easier table creation in Datacore, mimicking Dataview’s simplicity.

### 4.2. **Zettelkasten Lookup System**

- A custom Zettelkasten system to query and filter notes based on the "folgezettel" property.

## 5. **Task Management in Datacore: Interactive UI**

### 5.1. **Interactive Task Modification**

- Adding clickable buttons to update task properties within a Dataview table.
- Real-time interaction to mark tasks as complete or modify task status.

### 5.2. **Search Filter Implementation**

- A dynamic search filter for task tables, allowing users to quickly filter tasks by name.
