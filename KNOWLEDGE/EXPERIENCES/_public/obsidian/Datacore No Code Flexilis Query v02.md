Just having a blast with this, but don't let me have all the fun - dive in and play around! 😄

Occasional bugs, Oh, and here's a pro tip: grab yourself an Obsidian code editor plugin. I'm using [Code Files](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=code-files) one [but feel free to explore others]. Trust me, it's an absolute game-changer!
