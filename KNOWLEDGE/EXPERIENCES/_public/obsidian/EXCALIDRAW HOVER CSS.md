## HERE WHAT CHATGPT GAVE SO FAR

Creating a hover effect on certain elements inside Excalidraw directly through the Excalidraw interface or API for web integration doesn't appear to be a built-in feature based on the available documentation. The primary focus of Excalidraw's API and developer tools is on creating, editing, and managing elements programmatically, with features like updating scene elements, managing the library, and handling user interactions such as pointer updates and scene changes​[](https://docs.excalidraw.com/docs/@excalidraw/excalidraw/api/excalidraw-element-skeleton)​​[](https://docs.excalidraw.com/docs/@excalidraw/excalidraw/api/props/excalidraw-api)​.

However, you could potentially implement custom hover effects on Excalidraw elements by using a combination of web development techniques and Excalidraw's API. For example, you could monitor mouse events over the canvas and use the positions to determine if the cursor is over an Excalidraw element. Then, you could manipulate the styling or properties of those elements using JavaScript, possibly by updating their appearance through the Excalidraw API​[](https://docs.excalidraw.com/docs/@excalidraw/excalidraw/api/props)​.

For specific functionalities like adding files, resetting the scene, or customizing elements, the Excalidraw API provides methods such as `updateScene`, `resetScene`, and `addFiles`. These could be used in creative ways to alter the presentation of elements during hover events by dynamically changing their properties when a hover action is detected​[](https://docs.excalidraw.com/docs/@excalidraw/excalidraw/api/props/excalidraw-api)​.

Since this would require custom development outside of the Excalidraw provided functionalities, you would need a good understanding of web technologies (JavaScript, React for Excalidraw components) and possibly a custom solution to track mouse position relative to Excalidraw elements on the canvas.

For detailed guides on how to use Excalidraw's API and integrate it into web applications, you can refer to the official [Excalidraw developer documentation](https://docs.excalidraw.com/). This includes instructions on how to integrate Excalidraw into your projects, customize its appearance, and interact with its elements programmatically.
