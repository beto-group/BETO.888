NOTE TO CREATOR 
	+ feature request
Loving this plugin. Absolutely game changer in the way I do things inside Obsidian. I'm starting to notice that when drawing and create a drawing too complicated will make canvas laggy. What I would like to see is the possible to have "group" or "area" generate image instead of being reference to a certain location on canvas. This way you could have excalidraw canvas for each assets themselves and using the png [svg format would be too cool] inside other canvases while keeping lag to a minimum Keep up the great work truly 👏

#### About Visual Presentation

##### Advantages:

- **Clarity:**
    - Visuals provide clear representation of information.
- **Ease of Navigation:**
    - Personal illustrations make navigation intuitive.
- **Complex Structures:**
    - More complex structures can be maintained without losing readability.
- **Nonlinear Connections:**
    - Illustrations can reflect nonlinear connections better.
- **Narrative Creation:**
    - Create narratives or stories, making re-application easier.

##### Disadvantages:

- **Time-Consuming:**
    - Requires significant time investment.
- **Illustration vs. Text:**
    - Not always practical to use illustrations over text.

#### General Essence

- Draw notes in Excalidraw.
- Create new notes and links through Excalidraw.
- Customize and expand as desired.

#### Example of Implementation

- **First Entry Point:**
    
    - Use the "me" page as the first entry point.
    - Interests like books, science, and cooking are indicated.
    - Links to a calendar and projects.
    
- **Calendar Link:**
    
    - Clicking on the calendar brings up a visual calendar.
    
- **Book Section:**
    
    - Clicking on the books section, you might find something like Shakespeare waiting.

#### Excalidraw Plugin

- **Convenient Implementation:** Illustrations are easily created with the Excalidraw plugin.
- **Ease of Use:** The basic functionality is simple to learn and master on your own.
- **Versatility:** Excalidraw drawings can be used almost as a standalone tool within Obsidian.

#### Power of Illustrations

- **Nonlinear Connections:** Illustrations can depict complex, nonlinear relationships.
- **Associative Relationships:** Visuals can help reveal associative links.
- **Visual Narrative:** Combining pictures, icons, and text enhances understanding and memory retention.

#### Alternative Illustration Methods

- **Without Plugins:** Obsidian can be used without plugins, but there are some trade-offs.
- **JPG or PNG Formats:**
    - **Pros:** More popular formats.
    - **Cons:** Lose flexibility, need to manage source files (e.g., PSD files) separately, and require multiple steps to update images in Obsidian.

#### Editing Illustrations

- **Light Raster Editors:** Editing in light raster editors can be a workaround.
    - **Set Default Editor:** Install a light raster editor as the default program for images.
    - **Direct Launch from Obsidian:** This allows you to open and edit images directly from Obsidian.
- **Excalidraw Advantage:** Despite alternatives, using Excalidraw remains the simplest and most efficient method for creating and editing illustrations within Obsidian.
