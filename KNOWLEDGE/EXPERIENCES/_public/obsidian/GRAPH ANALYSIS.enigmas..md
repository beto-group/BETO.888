### Graph Analysis and NLP Algorithms in Obsidian

#### Overview

- **Graph Analysis**:
    - Implements algorithms to assess relationships between notes.
    - Analyzes either the connection graph or the text in the note (NLP).
    - Results in a hierarchical list of notes that show the degree of compliance with the selected note.

#### NLP Algorithms

- **Current Status**:
    - In test mode.
    - Requires manual installation or via the "Obsidian42 BRAT" plugin for beta plugins.

#### Steps to Add NLP Support

1. **Install "Obsidian42 BRAT"**:
    
    - Allows adding beta versions of plugins.
2. **Add the NLP Plugin**:
    
    - Go to "Add Beta Plugin" settings in BRAT.
    - Add the plugin named "SkepticMystic/nlp".
3. **Activate the NLP Plugin**:
    
    - Turn on the plugin.
    - In its settings, click on "Indexation to Work".
4. **Restart Obsidian**:
    
    - The plugin will index your knowledge base by its content.
    - Initial indexing may slow down startup (this happens only once).

#### Using NLP Algorithms

- **Results**:
    - Periodically check the plugin's suggestions.
    - May reveal interesting ideas and associations.
    - Shows theoretical popularity of notes and potential clusters.

#### Practical Use and Recommendations

- **Periodic Review**:
    
    - Regularly review what the plugin offers for new insights.
- **Understanding Popularity and Clusters**:
    
    - The plugin shows notes that attract more attention.
    - Provides information on notes forming clusters.

#### Personal Note

- **Graph Visualization**:
    - Personal preference for seeing note relationships on the graph.
    - The plugin's insights may be less useful if you prefer visual analysis.

#### Conclusion

- **Enhanced Analysis**:
    
    - Graph Analysis and NLP algorithms provide deeper insights into note relationships.
    - Useful for identifying new connections and popular notes within your knowledge base.
- **Customization and Use**:
    
    - Customize settings to suit your workflow.
    - Use the plugin's suggestions to enhance your note-taking and knowledge management.
