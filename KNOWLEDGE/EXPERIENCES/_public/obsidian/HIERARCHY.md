### Hierarchical Notes (Breadcrubs + Excalibrain)

#### Understanding Hierarchy

- **Basic Concept**:
    - Hierarchy involves parent-child relationships.
    - Example: You are a child to your parent, making your parent a source of your appearance.
    - Siblings are on the same level as you.
    - Neighbors have a similar hierarchical structure but are united by geographical position.

#### Plugins

- **Breadcrubs**:
    
    - Used to form and organize hierarchical structures.
- **Excalibrain**:
    
    - Visual representation of hierarchical structures.

#### Basic Functionality

1. **Parent-Child Relationship**:
    
    - Use metadata to indicate connections.
    - Example: Father (parent) â†’ Son (child).
2. **Complete Family Example**:
    
    - Father has a daughter and a son.
    - Mother is on the same level as the father.
    - Neighbors are connected through geographical proximity.
3. **Metadata**:
    
    - Indicate connections in metadata.
    - Example: "parent", "child", "sibling", etc.
4. **Hierarchy Display Order**:
    
    - Can be changed in settings.

#### Examples

1. **Basic Example with Parent**:
    
    - Source note (book) indicates it has a child (synopsis).
2. **Development with Author and Category**:
    
    - Add author and category as parent in settings.
3. **Example with Next and Previous**:
    
    - Navigate through summaries.
    - Clear navigation on all summaries.
4. **Example with Same Level**:
    
    - Understand how to tune the view to show same-level connections.
5. **Complex Hierarchy**:
    
    - Example of a note summarizing sources and knowledge.

#### Important Subtleties

1. **YAML and Metadata**:
    
    - Links in metadata are not formally created but live in the plugin space.
    - Integrate all links into the text if necessary.
2. **Hierarchy Display**:
    
    - Customize display order in settings.

#### Recommendations

- **Set and Use Different Hierarchies**:
    
    - Adjust settings to reflect the hierarchical structure of your notes.
- **Potential Benefits**:
    
    - Helps in organizing and navigating through notes.
    - Enhances understanding of relationships between notes.
- **Explore Further**:
    
    - Detailed documentation for advanced workflows and settings.

### Summary

- **Hierarchy**:
    
    - Establish parent-child and same-level relationships.
    - Use Breadcrubs for organization and Excalibrain for visualization.
- **Practical Application**:
    
    - Implement hierarchical structures in your knowledge base.
    - Customize settings and metadata to reflect relationships accurately.
- **Conclusion**:
    
    - Determine the relevance and benefits of hierarchical notes for your knowledge base.
