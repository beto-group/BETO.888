Icons to better visually navigate within your vault.

## EXPLANATION

The Iconize plugin for Obsidian is designed to enhance the visual representation of folders and files within your vault. It offers the ability to customize icons associated with folders and files using either custom icons in .svg format or predefined icon packs.

Key features of the Iconize plugin include:

1. Predefined Icon Packs: The plugin comes with support for several popular icon packs, such as Remixicon, Fontawesome, IconBrew, SimpleIcons, LucideIcons, BoxIcons, and RPG Awesome. These packs provide a wide range of icons that you can choose from to customize your folders and files.

2. Custom Icons: Iconize allows you to add and use your own custom icons in .svg format. You can drag and drop these icons into the plugin's icon packs or select multiple files at once.

3. Changing Folder Icons: With Iconize, you can easily change the icon associated with a folder. By right-clicking on a folder and selecting the "Change Icon" option, you can choose a new icon from the available options or your custom icons.

4. Inherited Icons: The plugin provides the ability to set an inherited icon for a folder. This means that all files within that folder will automatically adopt the same icon. This feature helps maintain visual consistency within your vault.

5. Custom Rules: Iconize allows you to define custom rules based on regular expressions or simple string comparisons. With these rules, you can automatically assign specific icons to files and folders based on predefined conditions, making it easier to organize and navigate your vault.

6. Emoji Support: The plugin supports using emojis as folder icons. By utilizing the Twemoji library, you can set emojis as icons for folders, adding a touch of personalization and visual flair to your vault.

The Iconize plugin provides a convenient way to customize the icons associated with your folders and files in Obsidian. Whether you prefer to use predefined icon packs, your own custom icons, or emojis, Iconize helps you create a visually appealing and organized workspace.
