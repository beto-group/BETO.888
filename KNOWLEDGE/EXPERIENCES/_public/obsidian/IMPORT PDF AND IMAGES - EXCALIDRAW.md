**Inserting a PDF File**:

- There are two ways to insert a PDF file into Excalidraw.
- First, we'll look at the "as PDF" option.
- This option imports the pages as images.
- You can freely organize these images on the infinite canvas.
- Circle, arrow, highlight, and comment on these images as needed, just like on paper.
