### Challenges of Taking Notes on Movies

#### Personal Observations

- **Limited Value:** I find it challenging to extract valuable insights from movies.
- **Lack of Connectivity:** Notes on movies rarely connect with other notes, leading to doubts about their validity and usefulness.
- **Long Processing Time:** Watching movies with a pencil is time-consuming and labor-intensive.

#### Time Investment

- **Watching the Movie:** 2 hours.
- **Initial Note-Taking:** 30 minutes for jotting down notes from memory.
- **Clarification and Additional Research:** 1-2 hours to verify details and search for additional insights.
- **Atomization and Binding:** 2-4 hours to process notes into atomic, interconnected pieces.

#### Outcome

- **Isolated Notes:** Despite the extensive effort, the resulting notes often remain valid only within the context of the specific movie.
- **Questioning Validity:** This isolation leads to prolonged periods of unprocessed notes, further amplifying doubts about their worth.

#### Conclusion

- **Critical Mass and Passion:** To derive tangible benefits from movie notes, one would need to amass a significant quantity of notes and have a deep passion for films.
- **Efficiency:** Given the extensive time and effort required, it may be more efficient to focus on other mediums or approaches for gaining and connecting insights.
