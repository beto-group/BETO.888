#### Step-by-Step in Obsidian

1. **Add Metadata to Permanent Notes**
    
    - **Metadata Format:**
        
        yaml
        
        Copy code
        
        `topic: links:  tags: #permanent-note --- 1234`
        
2. **Add Links to Existing Notes**
    
    - **Action:** Connect your permanent note to other notes in the slip-box or add links from existing notes to the new note.
    - **Question to Ask:** Can these two notes be strung together to make a point or support an argument?

> **Note:** If there are no other notes to link to, keep the links metadata section to remind you to establish connections in the future.

#### Adding Notes to the Index

- **Importance:** Connections between notes are vital, but the index ensures notes arenâ€™t forgotten.

1. **Create an Index Note**
    
    - **Purpose:** Provides an overview of a specific topic, not the entire slip-box.
    - **Question to Ask:** "If I were to find this information in a bookstore, which section would I find it under?"
2. **Creating and Naming the Index Note**
    
    - **Action:** Open your permanent note and review its contents.
    - **Create a New Note:** Name it after a relevant section or genre in the library.
3. **Add Information to the Index Note**
    
    - **Index Note Format:**
        
        yaml
        
        Copy code
        
        `tags: #index-note ### Key Topics --- [[permanent note]] 12345678910`
        
    - **Replace** `[[permanent note]]` with a link to your permanent note in the slip-box.
4. **Update Permanent Notes with Index Information**
    
    - **Action:** Link the permanent notes to their new index topic.
    - **Benefit:** Bidirectional linking in Obsidian makes navigation easier.

#### Maintaining and Evolving the Index

- **Staging Area:** Place permanent notes directly in the index initially.
- **Emerging Topics:** As you continue taking notes, topics and sub-topics will emerge.
- **Reorganization:** Move links to the permanent notes from the index to these new topics and replace them in the index with a link to the topic under Key Topics.
