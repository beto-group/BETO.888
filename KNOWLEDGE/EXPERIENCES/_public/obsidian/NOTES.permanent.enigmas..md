### How to Take Permanent Notes in Obsidian

#### 1. Review Your Notes

- **Frequency:** Once daily, review your fleeting and literature notes.
- **Process:** Translate them into permanent notes using the following steps:
    - Identify relevant content for your research, interests, or thinking.
    - Elaborate on ideas until they are clear without prior context.
    - Connect and link them to existing permanent notes in the slip-box.

> "If you canâ€™t say it clearly, you donâ€™t understand it yourself." â€” John Searle

#### 5. Write Permanent Notes

- **Reference:** Use the existing fleeting or literature note as a writing prompt.
- **Clarity:** Ensure the idea can be understood without its original context.
- **Quality:** Write in full sentences, be concise, and clear. Each note should be atomic, containing only a single idea.

#### 6. Determine Note Length

- **Guidelines:**
    - Minimum length: 180 characters (tweet).
    - Maximum length: 300-500 words (atomic essay).

#### 7. Assign Keywords

- **ID and Keyword:** Append the keyword to the note's name after the ZettelkastenID prefix.
- **Separation:** Separate the keyword and prefix with a space and a hyphen for readability.
- **Keyword Selection:** Choose keywords that reflect the contexts in which you will want to find the note in the future.
