#### Fast and Intensive Learning

- **Rapid Pace:** Courses move quickly and require intense focus, leading to frequent challenges.
- **Active Overcoming:** Overcome challenges using schemes, illustrations, and mind maps.

#### Staying Ahead in Learning

- **Go Beyond the Material:**
    - **Primary Representation:** Always try to go a bit further ahead in the material to form a more coherent primary understanding.
    - **Illustration and Schemes:** Convert this understanding into illustrations or schemes that make the material more digestible.

#### Intensive Learning Techniques

- **Documentation:**
    - **Progress Logs:** Keep detailed logs of your progress, outlining what you've done and connected.
    - **Hierarchy and Outliner:** Form an outliner of communication notes to create a hierarchy and draw mental maps throughout the course.
    - **Roadmaps:** Draw roadmaps to visualize your learning path.
- **Practical Courses:**
    - **Immediate Application:** For practical courses (e.g., making a donut in Blender), skip the notes and focus on watching and doing immediately.

#### Tools for Visual Learning

- **Canvas and Excalidraw:** Utilize tools like Canvas or Excalidraw to draw mental maps and roadmaps, enhancing your understanding and retention of the material.

By adopting these strategies for both books and courses, you can maximize your learning experience, ensuring a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the material. Staying ahead and actively engaging with the content will lead to better outcomes and a more structured knowledge base.

#### The Power of Consistent Learning

- **Transformative Impact:** Starting a knowledge base from the first day of university can drastically change your learning experience.
- **Beyond Information Retrieval:** Learning is a process of research, not just retrieving information. The university acts as a tough curator, guiding through the initial stages of ignorance and misunderstanding.

### Benefits and Disadvantages of Courses

#### Course Benefits

1. **Reduced Complexity:**
    
    - Courses simplify the learning process, acting like a mini-university.
    - They provide a structured path to understanding fundamental concepts quickly.
2. **Community Support:**
    
    - Many courses have an active community, offering various explanations and extensions of the material.
    - Additional third-party materials used in courses enhance the learning experience.
3. **Structured Exercises:**
    
    - Courses include exercises to improve understanding, something individuals might struggle to create on their own.

#### Course Disadvantages

1. **Lack of Unique Selling Proposition:**
    
    - Courses and universities do not provide unique knowledge that can be highly valued or monetized.
    - They offer widely known information, making it difficult to gain a competitive edge.
2. **Course Creation:**
    
    - Courses are created based on existing, well-trodden paths, offering no groundbreaking insights or discoveries.
    - Information from open sources is structured and sold as courses, often without any unique methods for outstanding results.

### Processing Courses Effectively

#### Strategic Use of Courses

1. **Starting Point:**
    
    - Courses are ideal for small-sized areas of study, creating a backbone of notes for further expansion.
    - This backbone can be deepened with more serious sources over time.
2. **Work with Courses:**
    
    - Understand that courses allow for quick results in well-established areas but are not designed for advanced opportunities in new fields.
    - Use courses to gain fundamental knowledge and then expand with in-depth research.

### Conclusion

By maintaining a knowledge base from the beginning and strategically using courses, you can enhance your learning process, gain fundamental insights quickly, and build a solid foundation for more advanced research and understanding.
