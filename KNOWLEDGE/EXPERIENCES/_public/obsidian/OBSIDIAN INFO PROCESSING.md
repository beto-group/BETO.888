## ENIGMAS
----

### Idea 1. Minimalism and simplicity

#### General Principle

- Do not overcomplicate hierarchy, systematization, plugins, or functions.
- Keep it as simple as possible.

#### Questions to Ask Before Improving

- Does this complicate the process?
- Can this confuse me in the future?
- Can I forget the inner logic of my improvement?
- Does this disrupt my current process?

#### Hotkeys

- Can be customized extensively.
- Use only the most important and necessary shortcuts.
- Unused shortcuts won't affect the system.

#### Plugins for Obsidian

- Zero plugins are needed for effective use.
- Dataview plugin is a helpful addition but not essential.
- Focus on a well-thought-out and optimized workflow.
- Core process revolves around hard links (basic function of MD file format).

#### When to Use Plugins

- Only after developing your system and identifying specific needs.
- Useful for maintaining a diary or knowledge base.
- Recommended plugins: Calendar, Periodic Notes, Templater.

#### Risks of Overcomplication

- Unnecessary changes can disrupt an effective system.
- Results in frustration, loss of trust, decreased motivation, and system degradation.
- Quality of the knowledge base is determined by the trust in it.
- Overcomplication reduces ease and engagement in the research process.

#### Summary

- Avoid adding unnecessary complexity.
- Overly complex systems hinder new ideas and connections.
- Complex hierarchies and plugins can slow down the software and cause frustration.



### Idea 2. Consistency and gradualness

#### Initial Impulse

- Desire to add extensive logic and functional twists immediately.
- These may seem vital but are not necessary right away.
- Head needs time to assimilate new information and processing methods.
- Rushing can lead to the system collapsing like a house of cards.

#### Gradual Development

- Build the system slowly and measuredly.
- Form reference notes and shorter paths to entry points during the process.
- Add new interests and notes according to strict logical rules.
- Define a sequence for information processing.

#### Note Formation Process

- **Consistent and Gradual Approach:**
    - Read a passage quickly without distractions or following links.
    - Re-read, leaving marks to form a summary.
- **Summary Writing:**
    - Write a clear sequential statement in your own words.
    - Expand with thoughts, observations, and insert links and sources.
    - (If necessary) Form accompanying text.
    - Atomize the synopsis into individual notes.
    - Connect notes with others if relevant connections come to mind.
    - Meditate on the process.

#### Sequential Strength

- Do not aim for perfection in one go.
- Gradually collect, structure, and connect thoughts.
- Each stage of processing should:
    1. Be associated with the previous one.
    2. Qualitatively differ from the previous one.
- Each stage has a distinct task, providing a new perspective on the information.

#### Reading Algorithm (Summary)

1. Quickly read a passage without distractions.
2. Re-read and leave marks for summary formation.
3. Write a clear, sequential summary in your own words.
4. Expand the summary with thoughts, observations, and links.
5. Form accompanying text if necessary.
6. Atomize the summary into individual notes.
7. Connect related notes.
8. Reflect on the process.

#### Conclusion

- Avoid overloading yourself with too much information at once.
- Sequential stages of information processing provide new perspectives and prevent overload.
- Each stage’s distinct task, connected to the previous, ensures comprehensive understanding and organization.


### Idea 3. Without fear and without plan

#### Controversial but Necessary

- Some might find this idea controversial, but it is crucial for maintaining an effective knowledge base.

#### Example from Libraries

- Libraries catalog sources with detailed metadata:
    - Name
    - Authors
    - Year of publication
    - Place of publication
    - Number of pages
    - GRNES
    - UDC
    - Rubrics
    - Subject headings
    - Access points
    - Document holders
    - DOI
    - Keywords
    - Quotations
- This metadata aids in searching but requires specialized education to understand and use effectively.
- Over-complication can detract from more important tasks.

#### Main Goal of a Knowledge Base

- The primary goal is to facilitate useful intellectual work:
    - Thinking
    - Reading
    - Understanding and awareness
    - Inventing ideas and their embodiment
- Predicting the direction of research is impossible, so flexibility is crucial.

#### Risks of Over-Classification

- Detailed classification systems and research planning can hinder the integration of new ideas.
- After a long break, complexity can increase, diminishing interest in maintaining the knowledge base.
- Over-complication might lead to doing unnecessary work.
- Simplification, such as creating meta-notes, can be more effective than increasing complexity.

#### Relationship Between Classification and Planning

- Initial impulse to plan and categorize everything in the knowledge base can lead to:
    - Mental exhaustion
    - Increased system complexity
    - Unjustified entities in an empty base
- Comparable to planning how to spend a million dollars you don’t have: actual possession would lead to more reasonable and careful thinking.
