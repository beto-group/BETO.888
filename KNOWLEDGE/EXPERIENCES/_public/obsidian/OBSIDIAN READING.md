### Reading

#### 1st time ( quick familiarization )

#### Purpose

- The initial reading is to form a first impression or a superficial understanding of the text.
- Avoid "lubricating" the text; spoilers can be a helpful shortcut to grasp the main points quickly.

#### Quick Read Properties

- **Speed:** Read at a pace 20% faster than your comfortable reading speed to enhance focus and mobilize attention.
- **Continuity:** Read continuously without stopping to follow links or check notes. Aim for a general understanding without focusing on details.
- **Main Task:** Extract the main point of the text as quickly as possible to make the subsequent, in-depth reading smoother and more consistent.

#### Benefits

- **Engagement:** Capturing the main essence initially provides joy and motivation for deeper exploration.
- **Relevance:** Answering "What have I just read?" in general terms after the first read helps affirm the relevance and importance of the information to your brain.
- **Foundation:** This practice provides a solid primary understanding, making it easier to delve deeper into the material in future readings.

#### 2nd time ( separation of reference points )

#### Purpose

- The second reading is to identify and tag valuable information in the text, which will be used to form notes.

#### Approach

- **Thoughtful Reading:** Read more carefully and deliberately than the first time.
- **Follow Links and Notes:** Engage with links and notes to deepen understanding.
- **Evaluate Information:** Constantly ask, "Is this valuable information?" If the answer is yes, select the fragment for tagging.

#### Tagging System

- **Color Coding:** Use a color-coding system to tag valuable fragments. (Details on specific colors will be provided next.)

#### Benefits

- **Enhanced Understanding:** Thoughtful reading and tagging help solidify comprehension.
- **Organized Notes:** Tagged fragments facilitate the creation of well-organized notes for future reference.
- **Efficient Review:** Color-coded tags make it easier to quickly locate and review important information later.

|Color|Meaning|

| COLOR     | MEANING                                                                                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Green** | Important information that needs to be remembered or processed                                        |
| Orange    | Accurate, reference information worth recording                                                       |
| Pink      | Beautiful expressions or quotes to be preserved unchanged in your knowledge base                      |
| Yellow    | References to other sources, information to be checked elsewhere, or sources to be mentioned in notes |


### Reader Requirements

#### Color Coding

- The program must support text coloring with different colors.
- The built-in Obsidian reader is unsuitable as it lacks this feature.
- The Annotator plugin is also unsuitable because it only supports single-color highlighting.

#### Annotation Features

- The reader should support text notes and drawing arbitrary lines.
- These features are necessary for jotting down important thoughts and linking elements on the page.
- All functions should be accessible with one click, preferably with tools switchable by keys or hotkeys.

#### Recommended Program

- **Okular:** This program supports pdf and djvu (among other formats), and allows easy and quick text annotation.
- **Benefits:**
    - Free to use
    - Supports multiple annotation features

#### Electronic Readers

- Electronic readers are less suitable for this task due to limitations in color coding and annotation capabilities.


#### 3rd time ( inspection )

#### Follow Your Marks

- Start by following the marks you made during the second reading.

#### Planning the Synopsis

- **External Plan:** Create a plan as a model for your synopsis, not just in your head.
- **Components:** Use headings, and names of notes not yet created (ghosts).
- **Purpose:** Helps to break down the work into stages, making it more manageable.
- **Flexibility:** The plan is a guide for the current stage or the next hour, not the entire system.
- **Progress Indicator:** The plan serves as a progress indicator, motivating continued work.

#### Gradual Approach

- **Avoid Over-Planning:** Do not create a framework for the entire book or all chapters at once.
- **Importance of Gradualness:** Take it step by step to avoid overwhelm.

#### Writing the Synopsis

- **Linear Formation:** Typically, the synopsis will be linear, but remain flexible.
- **Personalization:** Write in your own words, clarify where needed, and summarize appropriately.
- **Adaptability:** Adjust the synopsis to fit your capabilities and preferences.

#### Handling Writer's Block

- **Visual Tools:**
    - **Illustrations**
    - **Diagrams**
    - **Mindmaps**
- **Advanced Text Tool:**
    - **Outline**
- **Other Tools:** Explore additional tools as needed.



#### Nth time reading

#### Regular Reading Habit

- Reading 70 books a year indicates a well-developed habit of regular reading.
- However, the true usefulness of this habit may be limited to impressing others with your reading volume.
- Otherwise, it may not distinguish you from those who read less or only consume simpler content.

#### Thought Experiment: Extracting Knowledge

- Imagine reading "Black Swan" by Nassim Taleb thoroughly, from beginning to end, marking important sections.
- Now, suppose someone asks you to articulate 150 non-trivial thoughts and ideas from the book, not just quotes but your own understanding.
    - **Challenge:** This task highlights the difficulty of extracting substantial knowledge from complex books.
    - **Common Response:** You might struggle to recall and articulate more than a few key points, despite thorough reading.

#### Complexity of Extracting Knowledge

- Extracting valuable insights from complex texts is a challenging task.
- Such books often contain a myriad of intricate, non-trivial ideas that require deep engagement and understanding.
- Slow, thoughtful reading is often necessary to grasp these complex concepts.

#### Value of Slow Reading

- **Slow Reading:** Embracing a slower pace allows for better comprehension and deeper understanding.
- **Misconception:** Quickly skimming difficult sections may give a false sense of knowledge.
- **Awareness vs. Understanding:** Becoming knowledgeable through rapid reading may not translate to meaningful understanding or practical application.

#### Conclusion

- Fast, extensive reading can increase general knowledge, but may not significantly enhance understanding or insight.
- Focus on thoughtful, slow reading to truly grasp and retain complex ideas, rather than merely increasing the number of books read.
