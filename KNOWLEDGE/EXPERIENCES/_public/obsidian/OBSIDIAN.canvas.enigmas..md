Infinite space to research, brainstorm, diagram, and lay out your ideas.

## EXPLANATION

Obsidian Canvas is a core plugin that comes with Obsidian for free, offering a visual way to organize and explore your ideas. It provides an infinite space where you can conduct research, brainstorm, create diagrams, and lay out your thoughts.

With Canvas, you have the flexibility to embed your notes alongside various media types such as images, PDFs, videos, audio, and even interactive web pages. This makes it a versatile playground for thought, allowing you to integrate different forms of content to enhance your ideation process.

In Obsidian 1.0 for desktop and mobile, Canvas introduces a new way of thinking by enabling you to effortlessly add existing notes and media from your vault and edit them within the Canvas view. You can embed Canvas views within notes, and even nest them within other Canvas views, providing a hierarchical structure for your ideas.

What makes Canvas even more powerful is its extensibility and interoperability. Like other aspects of Obsidian, Canvas is designed to be durable and can be enhanced through plugins created with the Obsidian API. This allows developers to add new capabilities to Canvas, expanding its functionality to suit individual needs.

Canvas files are stored locally using an open JSON file format that is compatible with other tools. This means that apps, scripts, and plugins can easily enhance Canvas by adding or modifying cards and connections, making it a versatile and adaptable tool in your creative workflow.

To see how others are utilizing Canvas in their personal and professional lives, the Obsidian community provides demos that showcase different use cases and inspire you to explore the possibilities of this visual organizational tool.
