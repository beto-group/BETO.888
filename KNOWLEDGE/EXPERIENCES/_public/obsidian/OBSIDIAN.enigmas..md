AMAZING video explaining obsidian
	NEED to learn LINKS more
		woah that concept blew my mind

>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0yAy2j-9V0

here a quick break down

### Possible Uses:

1. **Metadata Definition**
   
    `Author:: [[John Doe]] 
    `Category:: [[Productivity]]`
    
    → Allows querying all notes with the author "John Doe" or category "Productivity."
    
2. **Tagging with Named Properties**
    
    `Status:: [[In Progress]]`
    
    → Useful for tracking task or project statuses dynamically.
    
3. **Advanced Note Relations**
    
    `Related:: [[Project X]]`
    
    → Helps interconnect notes using meaningful links.
    

If you're using **Dataview**, you could then query:

`TABLE Named FROM "FolderName"`

COMMENT BY SOMEONE;

The only thing you really need to know to use Obsidian is markdown. Well, Obsidian has some unique syntax, so you might have to look at the sandbox vault or the [Help Docs 32](https://help.obsidian.md/Home) for that.

The graph view, frontmatter, and tagging features might be a bit confusing at first, but frontmatter is also a markdown feature, so there is a lot of online documentation on it. And with the graph view and tagging, its functions become clear once you start playing around with it.

A course might be helpful, but for me (and it’s probably just me) simply using Obsidian and playing around with it helped me ‘learn’ it a lot faster. I say ‘learn’ rather than learn, just because you don’t really learn how to use it, you just get used to using it. Right when you download Obsidian, you can start writing right away—you just have to get used to it.

It was confusing for me when I opened it up for the first time, but then I just started doing things in it, and I realized, “huh, this is actually pretty straightforward,” and my writing began right there. I suppose I had learned Obsidian in 20 minutes, but it took me maybe a week to really ‘learn’ it, which is when I figured out how to organize a ‘system’.

---

I guess what I’m saying is, it might be faster and easier to explore Obsidian and learn it that way instead of paying for a course on it. And when you have questions, you can look them up on Google or YouTube, and if that doesn’t work, even ask questions here.
