#### General Principles

- **Minimal Folders:** Create as few folders as possible to avoid confusion and maintain flexibility.
- **Avoid Overthinking:** Don't spend time deciding where to place each note; let the system manage connections and associations.
- **Connection Management:** Use links and tags to manage relationships between notes, ensuring flexibility and ease of navigation.

#### Recommended Folder Structure

- **ðŸ“‚ files:**
    
    - Store all file attachments (png, jpg, pdf, etc.)
    - Set as the default location for new attachments
    - Exclude from search results
- **ðŸ“‚ home:**
    
    - Contains the homepage (first entry point)
    - May include trackers and MOC (Map of Content) notes
    - Keep important files separate for easy access
- **ðŸ“‚ periodic:**
    
    - **ðŸ“‚ daily:** Daily log with daily notes
    - **ðŸ“‚ weekly:** Weekly log with weekly notes
    - **ðŸ“‚ templates:** Separate main templates from periodic note templates
    - Optionally include folders for monthly and annual notes
    - Exclude from search results
- **ðŸ“‚ projects:**
    
    - Create folders based on project directions (e.g., articles, YouTube, work, prototypes)
    - Keep project notes separate from the main knowledge base to manage expiration and archiving
- **ðŸ“‚ templates:**
    
    - Store all main templates used
    - Avoid creating excessive templates
    - Exclude from search results
- **Root Directory:**
    
    - Store the main knowledge base
    - Benefit from a clean search view without seeing paths to notes

### Conclusion

By maintaining a minimal and organized folder structure, you can streamline your workflow in Obsidian, avoid unnecessary complications, and focus on effective knowledge management.
