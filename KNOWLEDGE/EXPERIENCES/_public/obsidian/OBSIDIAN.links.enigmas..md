### Creating Integrated and Hidden Links in Obsidian

#### Integrated Links

**Purpose:**

- Integrated links provide immediate context and justification for the thought or idea being referenced.

**Example:**

markdown

Copy code

`The concept of **normal distribution** is fundamental in statistics [[normal distribution]] because it describes how data values are dispersed around the mean.`

#### Hidden Links

**Purpose:**

- If you want to add links but don't yet know how to integrate them, you can hide them to maintain a clean appearance.

**Example:**

markdown

Copy code

`This phenomenon is commonly observed in various fields of study. [[phenomenon]] ^hidden-link`

**Creating a Snippet to Hide Note Titles in Embeds**

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Create a CSS Snippet:**
    
    - Create a file named `naked-embeds.css`.
2. **Add the Following Content to `naked-embeds.css`:**
    
    css
    
    Copy code
    
    `.internal-embed .markdown-embed-title {     display: none; }`
    
3. **Place the Snippet in the Snippets Folder:**
    
    - Navigate to your knowledge base folder: `.../your_folder_with_database_knowledge/.obsidian/snippets/`
    - If the `snippets` folder does not exist, create it.
    - Place the `naked-embeds.css` file in the `snippets` folder.
4. **Enable the Snippet:**
    
    - Open Obsidian.
    - Go to `Settings` > `Appearance` > `CSS Snippets`.
    - Enable `naked-embeds`.

#### Usage in Notes

**Example of Integrated Links:**

markdown

Copy code

`The law of **supply and demand** is a fundamental economic principle [[supply and demand]] that affects pricing and market equilibrium.`

**Example of Hidden Links:**

markdown

Copy code

`The law of supply and demand is a fundamental economic principle that affects pricing and market equilibrium. [[supply and demand]] ^hidden-link`

**Combining Both Approaches:**

- Use integrated links for clear context and hidden links to maintain a clean appearance when embedding notes into other notes.

**Practical Tips:**

- Donâ€™t stress too much about perfect placement. The main goal is to ensure that links are present and useful.
- Regularly review and refine your links as your knowledge base evolves.

By following these steps, you can create a clean and efficient linking system within your Obsidian notes, enhancing readability and context while keeping your workspace organized.
