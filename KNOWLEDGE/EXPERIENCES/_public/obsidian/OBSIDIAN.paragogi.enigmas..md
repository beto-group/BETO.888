#### Plugin Recommendation

- **Projects Plugin:**
    - Allows you to track your projects within Obsidian.
    - Helps you organize and manage tasks without relying on folders.

#### Setup Instructions

1. **Install Projects Plugin:**
    
    - Install the "Projects" plugin in Obsidian.
2. **Operation for All Directions:**
    
    - For each direction or folder, repeat the same operation to create a project.
3. **Call Projects Command:**
    
    - Projects can be called by a command:
        
        sh
        
        Copy code
        
        `# Command to call the Projects plugin`
        
    - However, we will create a button for easier access.
4. **Example View:**
    
    - Your projects will look something like this:
        
5. **Kanban Plugin Integration:**
    
    - If you install the "Kanban" plugin, you can display your projects as a Kanban board.
6. **DB Folder Plugin Integration:**
    
    - Installing the "DB Folder" plugin adds a new display option.
    - This allows you to work with your projects similarly to how you would in Notion.

#### Additional Resources

- **Managing Personal Projects:**
    
    - Learn more about managing personal projects in Obsidian through this detailed [article](https://habr.com/ru/articles/789248/).
- **Example of Leading Projects:**
    
    - Another good example (VPN) on how to lead projects in Obsidian is available [here](https://ltroj.medium.com/engineering-project-management-in-obsidian-e6aade82dfff).

BUSINESS

#### Initial Recommendation

- **Avoid Starting with Obsidian:** While Obsidian can be equipped for business management, it's not recommended to start with this approach. [develop tools to make this wrong ezz]

#### Alternative Approach

- **Study GTD Method:** Begin by learning the Getting Things Done (GTD) method.
- **Use Todoist:** Implement GTD in a dedicated task management tool like Todoist.

#### Benefits of This Approach

- **Clear Distinction:** You will develop a clear distinction between business and planning systems and your knowledge management system.
- **Optimized Systems:**
    - **Business and Planning:** Use a dedicated tool like Todoist for business tasks and planning.
    - **Knowledge Management:** Use Obsidian solely for managing your knowledge base.

#### Conclusion

Starting with separate systems for business management and knowledge management allows you to benefit from tools specifically designed for each purpose, providing a more organized and effective workflow.
