OKAY so to add favicon u need to add this html to any of ur pages: can change sizes depending on logo sizing

```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="path/to/your/favicon-32x32.png"> 
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="96x96" href="path/to/your/favicon-96x96.png"> 
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="128x128" href="path/to/your/favicon-128x128.png">
```

to add logo. add an image to your publish site. make sure its published 
and not link that image using obsidian publish settings

AMAZING SET OF NOTE FOR ANY CREATOR TRYING TO DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO

This guy interesting
   https://github.com/akaalias/plotto-for-obsidian?tab=readme-ov-file
		HE'S BEEN UNACTIVE SINCE 3 YEARS ON YOUTUBE

His website is this
    https://publish.obsidian.md/alexisrondeau/My+%E2%80%9CGreatest+Hits%E2%80%9D
	    Vault a complete mess . hard to understand how to navigate
He got good achievements, the way of displaying those. 
   Great inspiintere


Question to ask ourselves if ideas isnt good

Just start with the biggest risk and stop if the answer is â€œNO.
1. Would I work on this in my free time?
2. Whatâ€™s the growth-rate in this niche?
3. How much do I care for this specific customer?
4. What keeps them up at night specifically?
5. What are they doing to fix this themselves?
6. What does their ideal solution look like?
7. How much is that worth to them?

WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS BETTER

RELATED : [[APODOSIS]]

Integrating CoinPayments into an Obsidian Publish site using their API involves a few steps, focusing on creating a seamless bridge between static content and dynamic payment functionality. Since Obsidian Publish primarily serves static content, the integration will rely on external links or buttons that lead to a payment process handled by CoinPayments. Hereâ€™s a general approach to achieve this:

### 1. **Set Up a CoinPayments Account**
- If you havenâ€™t already, sign up for a CoinPayments account.
- Navigate to your CoinPayments dashboard to access your API keys, which are necessary for creating payment requests.

### 2. **Create a Payment Button or Link**
- CoinPayments allows you to generate payment buttons or links directly from their platform. This is the simplest way to integrate with a static site like Obsidian Publish.
- In the CoinPayments dashboard, look for tools or sections where you can create a payment button or a payment link. You'll configure the currency, amount, and other transaction details.
- Once configured, CoinPayments will provide you with HTML code for a button or a direct link to the payment gateway.

### 3. **Embed in Obsidian Publish**
- **For a Payment Button**: If you choose to use an HTML payment button, you'll need to embed the HTML code provided by CoinPayments into your Obsidian note. Since Obsidian Publish supports embedding HTML within markdown files, you can insert the HTML snippet directly where you want the payment button to appear.
  
  ```markdown
  <!-- CoinPayments Button HTML -->
  <div>
      <!-- Insert CoinPayments HTML code here -->
  </div>
  ```
  
- **For a Payment Link**: If you prefer a simpler approach or if the HTML button doesnâ€™t work as expected, you can create a markdown link that directs users to the payment gateway. Use the link provided by CoinPayments to create a markdown link in your note.
  
  ```markdown
  [Pay with Crypto](https://yourcoinpaymentslinkhere)
  ```

### 4. **Test Your Integration**
- Before promoting your Obsidian Publish site with the CoinPayments integration, thoroughly test the payment process. This includes clicking the payment button or link, completing a transaction, and ensuring the funds are correctly processed and received in your CoinPayments account.

### Considerations
- **Security and Privacy**: Make sure that the integration process follows best practices for security, especially since you're dealing with financial transactions. Always keep your API keys confidential and ensure that your CoinPayments account is secured.
- **User Experience**: Clearly indicate on your Obsidian Publish site what the payment is for and what the user should expect through the entire process. This includes instructions for payment verification and how they will receive the product or service they're paying for.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Familiarize yourself with and adhere to any legal requirements and tax implications related to receiving cryptocurrency payments for your goods or services.

This approach allows you to incorporate CoinPayments into your Obsidian Publish site without needing to write direct API calls, making it more suitable for static sites that donâ€™t support server-side processing.
