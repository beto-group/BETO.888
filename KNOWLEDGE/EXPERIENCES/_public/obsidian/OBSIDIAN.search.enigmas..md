## EXPLANATION

Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. One of the great features of Obsidian is its powerful search functionality, which allows you to quickly and easily find the information you need within your vault of notes.

To search throughout your entire vault, you can use the keyboard shortcut COMMAND + SHIFT + F (on Mac) or CTRL + SHIFT + F (on Windows). This will bring up the search bar where you can enter your search query.

If you want to search specifically for a file name, you can use the syntax `file:[name_of_file]`. For example, to find a file named "chocolate_chip_cookies", you would enter `file:chocolate_chip_cookies`.

To search within the content of your files, use `content:[what_you_looking_for]`. For example, to find notes that mention "gluten-free", you would enter `content:gluten-free`.

To search by any properties, use `[property:[what_you_looking_for]]`. For example, to find notes that have a genre of "poulet", you would enter `[genre:poulet]`.

The search popup in Obsidian is user-friendly and helps you to easily understand your search queries.

In addition to the basic text, Obsidian also allows for metadata to be added to files. This metadata can be used to sort and filter your notes. The metadata for a recipe file in Obsidian may include:

- tags: Used for food types (e.g., keto, paleo) or cultural origins (e.g., Italian, Asian, Indian).
- genre: Keywords used by the note creator. For example, "poulet", "feculent", "legume".
- keywords: General keywords to describe the recipe, usually found in the title, such as "spaghetti", "ice cream".
- source: Who added the recipe to the cookbook, for example, "Sophie", "Marise", "Jacqueline".
- link: Where the recipe was found.

The note may also include general information such as a longer title or description, a rating, the time it takes to make the recipe, the number of servings, the calorie count, the ingredients needed, and the required equipment.

The same kind of metadata can be applied to other types of notes as well, not just recipes.

Remember to keep your filenames, tags, genres, and keywords to one word if possible. If multiple words are needed, use a hyphen to connect them. For example, use "stir-fry" instead of "stir fry". This will ensure your notes are easier to search and organize within Obsidian.
