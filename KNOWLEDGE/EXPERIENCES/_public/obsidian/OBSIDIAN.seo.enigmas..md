_This doesn't mean the pages can't be crawled, indexed, or ranked... it just means you can't rely on the sidebar as an access point for the search bots to crawl and discover all your published notes/pages... which in turn means that you can't rely on the sidebar links, sublinks, or groupings to communicate any site hierarchy or website structure to the search bots crawling and analyzing your site._



SEO terms:



- **PageRank** is an algorithm developed by Google to measure the "importance" of web pages based on the number and quality of links pointing to them.

- **Link Juice** (informal SEO term) refers to the flow of ranking power or authority passed from one page to another through hyperlinks. Pages with more high-quality inbound links have more "juice" to share with the pages they link to.
