### Recommended Layout for Obsidian Panels

#### Right Side

1. **Local Graph:**
    
    - **Purpose:** Allows you to visually see how notes are connected spatially.
    - **Usage:** Helps quickly understand where a thought originated and where it leads.
    - **Customization:**
        - Increase the graph's depth on larger monitors to see more information.
        - Color nodes by type for additional visual guidance (e.g., red for books, yellow for authors, green for podcasts).
2. **Headlines:**
    
    - **Purpose:** Constantly view the structure of long and complex notes.
    - **Usage:** Navigate through different sections of the note easily.

#### Left Side

1. **Incoming and Outgoing Links:**
    - **Purpose:** Provides a linear display of relationships when the visual graph is insufficient or too cluttered.
    - **Usage:** Easily navigate through the knowledge base by examining the linear connections.

#### General Advice

- **Stick to the Basics:**
    - Use this specific panel layout to build a solid understanding of hard links and relational information retrieval.
    - Avoid complicating the interface initially; focus on mastering the basics first.

#### Implementation

**Right Side Setup:**

1. **Local Graph:**
    
    - Open the local graph view for the current note.
    - Customize node colors based on the type of content (books, authors, podcasts, etc.).
2. **Headlines:**
    
    - Enable the table of contents (headlines) view to see the structure of the note.

**Left Side Setup:**

1. **Incoming Links:**
    
    - Display a panel showing all notes linking to the current note.
2. **Outgoing Links:**
    
    - Display a panel showing all notes that the current note links to.
