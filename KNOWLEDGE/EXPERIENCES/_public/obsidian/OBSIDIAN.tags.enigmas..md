### Simplifying Note Organization with Tags in Obsidian

#### General Principles

- **Avoid Unjustified Complexity:** Do not use tags to create hierarchies or complex relationships.
- **Selective Tagging:** Only tag notes that serve a specific purpose.

### Recommended Tags

1. **📥 – Incoming, Fleeting Notes**
    
    - Use this tag for notes that are temporary or need processing.
    - **Advice:** Only write down thoughts or ideas that you plan to process later. Filter out useless entries by questioning their relevance.
2. **⁇ म – Content Map Notes**
    
    - Tag categorical notes that help form a content map.
    - **Usage:** Start organizing notes with this tag when you have multiple sources on a topic.
    - **Visualization:** Use the graph view to see how these notes are interconnected and visualize areas of interest.
3. **⚛ – Notes Pending Breakdown**
    
    - Tag notes that need to be broken down into smaller, independent notes.
    - **Typical Use:** Applied to synopses that require further detailing.
4. **🌲 – Evergreen and Growth Notes**
    
    - Tag especially valuable notes or those you want to develop further.
    - **Usage:** Mark notes that are particularly interesting or valuable for ongoing development.
5. **🃏 – Flashcards (for Spaced Repetition)**
    
    - Tag notes you want to use for spaced repetition learning.**
    - **Nested Categories:** Create sub-tags for specific fields (e.g., 🃏/statistics).
6. **⏳ – Periodic Review Notes**
    
    - Tag notes that need to be reviewed periodically.
    - **Usage:** Use this tag for constant updating and revisiting of notes.

### Avoid Overcompensation with Tags

- **No Hierarchical Compensation:** Do not try to replace folder hierarchies with a complex tag structure.
- **Purpose-Driven Tagging:** Use tags selectively and purposefully to maintain simplicity and effectiveness.

### Example Usage

1. **Incoming Notes:**
    
    - `📥 Quick idea on data analysis methods`
2. **Content Map Notes:**
    
    - `⁇ म Data Science Concepts`
3. **Notes Pending Breakdown:**
    
    - `⚛ Summary of "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow`
4. **Evergreen and Growth Notes:**
    
    - `🌲 Key insights on neural networks`
5. **Flashcards:**
    
    - `🃏 /statistics Principles of statistical inference`
6. **Periodic Review Notes:**
    
    - `⏳ Monthly review of data science projects`

By following these guidelines, you can keep your tagging system simple and effective, ensuring that your knowledge base in Obsidian remains organized and easy to navigate.
