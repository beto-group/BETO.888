#### Main Essence

- An effective method for organizing thoughts when you can't gather them into a single coherent structure.
- Many programs are built around this method or its variations.

#### How the Method Works (Abstract Example)

- **Big Idea:** Start with a major thought or idea.
- **Expanding Ideas:** Add thoughts or ideas that expand or clarify the main idea.
- **Clarifications:** Add clarifications as needed, even if they differ in nature.
- **Lists and Properties:**
    - Create lists for different properties or aspects.
    - Discuss and elaborate on specific properties in detail.
- **Cross-Referencing:**
    - Link to related thoughts or ideas to maintain connections.
    - Acknowledge contributions from different authors and their clarifications.

#### Formal Structure

- Use a serial list to represent the hierarchy of thoughts with indentation.
- Example Structure:
    - Parent 1
        - Child 1
            - Grandchild 1
            - Grandchild 2
        - Child 2
    - Parent 2

#### Usage Example

**Text Example:** "When does conscious rational thinking come on stage? When trying to justify the choice after it was made. And this, after all, is the only way we have to try to explain to other people why we made a certain decision. However, not having access to the brain processes that have done all this, our excuse is often false: rationalization by the results of an event or even embarrassment â€“ 'history', born of a mixture of imagination and memory."

**Outline Processing:**

- **Rationalization:** Rational thinking is the only way to explain why we acted in a specific way.
    - **Inner World:** Inability to access internal brain processes often leads to misleading ourselves and others.
    - **Post-Event Explanation:** Rational explanations only after the event can discredit the explanation itself.
    - **Embarrassment:** Forming rational explanations unknowingly leads to embarrassment.
        - **Configuration:** A fictional story based on imagination and memory.
        - **Assumption:** Our tendency for rational explanations can lead to embarrassment.

#### Benefits of the Outline Method

- **Personalization:** Rewrite information in your own words for better understanding.
- **Flexibility:** Modify the structure and sequence of arguments to suit your comprehension.
- **Expansion:** Add thoughts and details beyond the original text to update and expand information in your mind.
- **Branching Ideas:** Turn points into separate notes, generating new branches of ideas and thoughts.


### Outliner Disadvantage

#### Linear Nature

- The outliner method is inherently text-based, resulting in a linear structure.
- This linearity can make it difficult to grasp the overall content and structure at a glance.

#### Lack of Spatial Information

- Unlike mind maps, the outliner method lacks spatial information.
- Viewing the text from afar or quickly skimming it may not provide a clear understanding of its content and organization.
