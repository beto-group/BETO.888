A.K.A : [METADATA]
## EXPLANATION

Properties, also known as metadata, in Obsidian help you organize and track structured data about your notes. By adding properties to a note, you can store information such as text, links, dates, and numbers. Properties can be used independently or in combination with community plugins that offer useful functionalities with structured data.

To add a property to a note, you have several options:

1. Use the "Add file property" command.
2. Utilize the Cmd/Ctrl+; hotkey.
3. Choose "Add file property" from the More actions menu (accessed via the three dots icon or right-clicking the tab).
4. Type "---" at the very beginning of a file.

Once a property is added, a row will appear at the top of the file with two inputs: the property name and the property value. You can choose any name for the property, although Obsidian provides default properties like tags, cssclasses, and aliases.

Each property has a type that describes the kind of values it can store. Property types can be changed by clicking the property's icon or using the "Edit file property" command. Obsidian supports various property types, including Text, List, Number, Checkbox, Date, and Date & time.

Advanced uses of properties include the ability to store links within Text and List type properties using the [[OBSIDIAN.links]] syntax. Properties have their own search syntax, which can be used in combination with other search terms and operators. Additionally, properties can be added to templates, where they will be automatically added to the active note when the template is inserted.

The display mode of properties can be customized by going to Settings → Editor → Properties in document. Options include "Visible" (properties displayed at the top of the note), "Hidden" (properties hidden but accessible via the Properties view), and "Source" (properties displayed in plain text YAML format).

It's important to note that some features are not supported in Obsidian, such as nested properties, bulk editing of properties, and using Markdown within properties. Properties are stored in YAML format at the top of the file, with property names separated from their values by a colon and space. Values can be text, numbers, true or false, or collections of values.

Obsidian also comes with default properties like tags, aliases, and cssclasses. These properties have specific purposes within Obsidian, such as styling individual notes or enabling features in Obsidian Publish.

By understanding and utilizing properties in Obsidian, you can organize and track structured data within your notes, enhancing their organization and functionality.
