### Automating Source Lists in Obsidian

#### Initial Manual Oversight

- **Create a simple list in a markdown note:**
    
    **Example Manual Source List:**


```
# Source List

## Books
- "Atomic Habits" by James Clear - PROCHIT
- "Deep Work" by Cal Newport - PROCHIT
- "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman

## Articles
- "The Rise of Data Science" - PROCHIT
- "Understanding Machine Learning" by Pedro Domingos

## Podcasts
- "The AI Alignment Problem"
- "Data Skeptic" - PROCHIT
```


#### Transition to Automation

- **Install Necessary Plugins:**
    
    - **Dataview:** Automates the creation and management of source lists.
- **Create Templates for Sources using Templater:**
    
    - **Example Book Template (`book_template.md`):**

```
---
type: book
status: unread
---
# Cheating to develop you visual vocabulary in Excalidraw

**Author:** 
**Published:** 
**Category:** 
**Notes:**
```


**Organize Source Notes:**

- Create a folder structure for your sources:

```
ðŸ“‚ Sources
    ðŸ“‚ Books
    ðŸ“‚ Articles
    ðŸ“‚ Podcasts
```


- **Use Dataview for Automated Lists:**
    
    - **Example Dataview Query for Books:**
        
        markdown
        
        Copy code
        
        `# Books  ```dataview table author as "Author", status as "Status" from "Sources/Books" sort file.name asc`
        
        Copy code
        
    - **Example Dataview Query for Articles:**
        
        markdown
        
        Copy code
        
        `# Articles  ```dataview table author as "Author", status as "Status" from "Sources/Articles" sort file.name asc`
        
        Copy code
        
    - **Example Dataview Query for Podcasts:**
        
        markdown
        
        Copy code
        
        `# Podcasts  ```dataview table status as "Status" from "Sources/Podcasts" sort file.name asc`
        
        Copy code
        

#### Example Source Note Using Template

- **Example Book Note (`Atomic Habits.md`):**
    
    markdown
    
    Copy code
    
    `--- type: book status: PROCHIT --- # Atomic Habits  **Author:** James Clear **Published:** 2018 **Category:** Self-help **Notes:** - This book emphasizes the importance of building small habits.`
    

#### Automating Status Updates

- Update the status of a source (e.g., from "unread" to "PROCHIT").
- The Dataview query will automatically reflect this change in your source list.

#### Final Thoughts

- **Benefits of Automation:**
    
    - Saves time and reduces the mental load associated with manually organizing and updating sources.
    - Makes source lists more dynamic and easier to maintain as your knowledge base grows.
- **Tips:**
    
    - Take breaks if needed and revisit the guide to fully understand the process.
    - Mastering these techniques will enable more advanced methods in the future.

SOURCES
### Building Your Knowledge Base from Sources
#### Primary Advice

When starting your knowledge base from scratch, begin by organizing it around your sources. This approach ensures a structured and comprehensive foundation for your information. Hereâ€™s an algorithm to illustrate this method:

### Step-by-Step Algorithm

1. **Create a Source Note:**
    
    - Start by creating a note with the name of the source, e.g., "From Atoms to Trees."
2. **Create a Synopsis Note:**
    
    - Inside the source note, create a link to a synopsis note, e.g., "[[Synopsis of From Atoms to Trees]]."
3. **Chapter Notes:**
    
    - Break the synopsis into notes corresponding to the chapters of the book. For each chapter, write detailed notes.
4. **Atomized Thoughts:**
    
    - Extract the most important atomized thoughts from the synopsis and place them in the source note.
5. **Structure Formation:**
    
    - Form structures from the notes using methods such as outlining to organize the information logically.
6. **Summarizing Notes:**
    
    - Write summary notes that encapsulate the key ideas and insights from the source.
7. **Special Interest Notes:**
    
    - Identify notes that are particularly interesting or that you want to develop further and place them in a separate category.

### Benefits of This Approach

- **Uncertain Areas of Interest:**
    
    - This method is ideal if youâ€™re unsure which areas of interest you want to focus on. It allows for flexibility as your interests evolve.
- **General Categories:**
    
    - Initially, you might not be able to accurately define the most general categories for your knowledge base. Starting with sources allows these categories to emerge naturally over time.
- **Easy Relocation:**
    
    - The work done inside the source note can easily be moved to the appropriate places later as your knowledge base grows.

### Sources

#### Verification of Information

- **Scientific Validation:**
    - Science is the best method we have for testing and validating complex ideas, despite its imperfections.
    - Trust scientific information, even if it seems frail or conflicting, over unverified information.
- **Framework Understanding:**
    - Knowing the context and framework in which information was received helps in assessing its validity without personal experimentation.

#### Development of Ideas

- **Reference for Future Use:**
    - Record sources for ideas, observations, and facts to develop them further.
    - A high-quality source is preferable for ensuring the reliability of information.

#### Preventing Misinterpretation

- **Error Checking:**
    - Sources help verify the correct interpretation of ideas and numerical data.
    - Ensure the context of recorded ideas matches the context of their original source.
- **Avoiding Redundancy:**
    - Without a source, re-verifying information can be tedious and may result in losing valuable data if the source cannot be found.

#### Source Credibility

- **Self-Support or Discredit:**
    - Sources may discredit themselves or be supported by additional materials.
    - This information is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of your knowledge base.

#### Criticism and Objectivity

- **Valuable Criticism:**
    - Other sources may critique your original sources, providing valuable insights.
- **Path to Objectivity:**
    - Ignoring sources limits your ability to achieve objective understanding and analysis.

#### Professional Acceptance

- **Serious Material:**
    - For serious or academic work, recorded sources are essential for acceptance by reputable publishers.

#### Differences in media species

#### Overview

- The working process of reading and summarizing is similar across both electronic and paper media.
- The choice often depends on personal preference and habits.
- Digital media offer several significant advantages over paper.

#### Advantages of Digital Media

1. **Cost Efficiency:**
    
    - **Free Books:** Many digital books are available for free.
    - **Piracy Considerations:**
        - The moral aspect of piracy diminishes due to the vast quantity of information available.
        - Supporting all creators financially is unrealistic.
        - Much literature is of low quality, making it unreasonable to pay for all content.
2. **Consumable Savings:**
    
    - **Supplies:** Items like liners, stickers, notebooks, pens, and pencils are consumables that cost money and deplete quickly when reading from paper.
3. **Navigation Convenience:**
    
    - **Paper Navigation:** Limited to finger bookmarks and often lacks user-friendly features.
    - **Digital Navigation:** Allows for compensating for poorly designed books by adding custom navigation aids.
4. **Search Functionality:**
    
    - **Digital Books:** Enable text recognition and search functionality, a substantial advantage for finding specific information quickly.

#### Conclusion

- While some may prefer the tactile experience of paper, digital media provide clear benefits in terms of cost, convenience, and functionality. The ability to search, navigate easily, and access free or low-cost books makes digital media a compelling choice for modern readers.
