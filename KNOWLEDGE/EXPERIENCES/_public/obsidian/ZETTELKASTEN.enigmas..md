## SEQUENCES
	CREATE SERIES OF NOTES

#### Step-by-Step in Obsidian

1. **Create a New Zettelkasten Note**
    
    - Click on **Create a new Zettelkasten note** in Obsidian.
2. **Browse and Open an Existing Permanent Note**
    
    - Open your slip-box.
    - Hold ⌘ + Shift then left-click (macOS) or Ctrl + Shift then left-click (Windows) to open an existing permanent note in a new horizontal panel.
3. **Start the Sequence**
    
    - Append `-1` at the end of the Zettelkasten prefix of the permanent note.
4. **Reflect and Brainstorm**
    
    - Ask yourself:
        - “What ideas does this permanent note spark?”
        - “If this existing permanent note were used to write an article, what information is missing?“
        - “What does this idea remind me of that I’ve read before?”
5. **Choose a Keyword**
    
    - After some thought, choose a keyword for the new permanent note and add it to the file name.
6. **Write the New Permanent Note**
    
    - Spend adequate time writing the contents of the new permanent note.
    - Ensure the note is concise, clear, and captures a single idea.

#### Tips for Note Sequences

- **Emergence of Topics:** Sequences form clusters where order emerges from complexity, helping develop and solidify your understanding.
- **Flexible Path:** There is no single linear path to taking permanent notes. Follow-up notes can result from personal thinking or other research sources.

#### Note on Zettelkasten IDs

- **Organize Sequences:** Zettelkasten IDs help organize sequences, but do not enforce a hierarchical structure.
- **Avoid Hierarchy:** Avoid the temptation to impose a hierarchical structure from the index down by refactoring ZettelkastenIDs as topics emerge.

---

#### Example of Starting a Sequence

1. **Create a New Zettelkasten Note**
    
    Copy code
    
    `20240613-1 - Follow-up Idea`
    
2. **Reflect and Brainstorm**
    
    - Existing note: `20240613 - Initial Idea`
    - New note: `20240613-1 - Related Thought`
3. **Write Content**
    
    - Elaborate on the ideas sparked by the initial note.
    - Connect it to the main topic and sub-topics as they emerge.

This approach will help you build a dynamic and interconnected knowledge base in Obsidian using the Zettelkasten method.

SOME ELSE DEFINITION

**Zettelkasten Method Overview**

- Involves three types of notes: fleeting, permanent, and project.
- Permanent notes are stored long-term in a reference system and a slip-box.
- Notes in the slip-box get unique identifiers, connecting to existing thoughts or starting new clusters.

**Unique Aspects of Zettelkasten**

- Slip-box connects notes, creating a latticework for an external knowledge base.

**Creating a Zettelkasten in Obsidian**

- **Four Underlying Principles:**
    - **Writing is The Only Thing that Matters:** Improves reading, thinking, and intellectual skills by writing about consumed information.
    - **Simplicity is Paramount:** Standardized note-taking reduces decision-making, with clear separation and designated storage for different note types.
    - **Nobody Ever Starts from Scratch:** Builds trust by connecting thoughts and improving thinking, making the process easier and more valuable.
    - **Let the Work Carry You Forward:** Workflow generates momentum through positive experiences and enhances the learning process.


**Learning System and Zettelkasten**

- Continuously improves thinking through deliberate practice and feedback.
- Utilizes three types of notes:



#### 3. Enable Zettelkasten Prefixer Plugin

- **Steps:**
    1. Open **Settings**.
    2. Click **Core plugins**.
    3. Toggle on the **Zettelkasten prefixer** plugin.

#### 4. Create a New Zettelkasten Note

- **Action:** Click **Create new Zettelkasten note** on the left panel to create a permanent note.
- **Open Existing Note:**
    - Open a fleeting or literature note in a new horizontal panel (⌘ + Shift + left click for macOS or Ctrl + Shift + left click for Windows).

### INITIAL BREAKDOWN when creating this system
	yes yes i believe

#insights #python #task-manager


# ORGANIZE!

# ORGANIZE!!

# ORGANIZE!!!

    Just do !
New entries always go inside the same file . Easy 
Make use of these:

U know what i mean?

So each new insights will be place square frame . Can easily see the different blocks
If new notes new to be added to this note we lj k



Linking shouldnt mean association
    SO in the sense some links are parent <-> child relationship
    But not always

wiki is the software
   zettlekasten are functions

The better functions / tools u create. The more benefits



GENERAL LINGO
	WHEN WANTING TO ACCESS OVERVIEW FILE. SEE FILE NAME SAME AS FOLDER





[[Note Taking]]
   GReat ressource



NEED A PRIORITY BOARD ASAP!!!


USE STATUS AS A WAY TO INDICATE WHICH FILE NEED AUTOMATION ?


IF WHEN AUTOMATION IS RUNNING AND THE TRANSACTIONS FOLDER ISNT CREATE FOR BANK / CRYPTO / ETC
CREATES FOLDER THEN PLACE NOTE INSIDE THAT FOLDER


WHEN AUTOMATING THE TYPE WILL ALSO INDICATE THE TYPE OF COINS EX
	- transaction-crypto
	- transaction-fiat

CUZ CRYPTO A BIT MORE COMPLICATED BUT DOABLE



AUTOMATE
	WHEN CREATING NEW FOLDER 
		GENERATE THE ATTATCH MASTER FILE /NOTE   [THE ONE USE TO LINK EVERYTHING ELSE]




## USE ASSOCIATION IN DATAVIEW TO EASILY LOCATE ENTRIES LINKING TO CERTAIN PAGE . FOR NOW NEED TO REWORK VIEWS




Forgot what i was about so say fuck. 

Have a dataview inside insights that search for tags si si si si si si 




Zettelkasten

WHEN IDEA GETS CREATES

NEED A WAY TO STORE DATA LATER SO THAT EASIER MANAGE SO WHEN WE DO IDEAL FILTERING OF INBOX

INTO DIFFERENT KANBAN

ONCE WE HAVE THEM IN THE DIFF ONES

WE CAN RUN A SCRIPT THAT WILL PLACE IN CORRELATION TO THE PROPERTIES WE ASSIGNS

MOSTLY THE TYPE

SO DEPENDING WILL CREATE A NEW FOLDER WITH SAME TITLE AS NOTE AND PLACE IT UNDER PROJECTS / AREA


I BELIEVE THIS DOESNT WORK FOR TASK QUITE YET

BUT ONCE WE HAVE CLEANED ENTRY DATA

WE RUN SCRIPT 

WE DONT NEED KANBAN [COULD BE USEFUL DO]
WE CREATE DATAVIEW
SO WE CAN GO THROUGH LIST AND CHECK EACH ENTRY AND ADD NECESSARY TAGS FOR PROCESSING 
	WHEN DATAVIEW SCREEN IS ALL CLEARED

[COULD CREATE TWO DATAVIEW . ONE FOR IMCOMPLETE AND ONE FOR COMPLETE TO SEE WHEN SUCCESSFUL ENTRIES GET ADDED CORRECTLY]


ONCE INITIAL FILTERING
RUN SCRIPT TO CHECK INBOX FOLDER.
DEPENDING ON THE TASK PLACE THE NOTE IN THE CORRECT FOLDER STRUCTURE



WILL CHECK TYPE PROPERTIES AND EITHER
	- ADD FILE TO CORRESPONDING FOLDER 
	- CREATE A NEW FOLDER THEN PLACE FILE IF DOESNT EXIST

WE CURRENTLY HAVE DIFFERENT TYPE NOT 100% sure it all good
	- task
	- area
	- project
	- goals
	- milestones
	- ressource


so a little bit of rework since dont quite makes sense ;P teehee


so type with determine the type of file we are creating right only if the type is 
- area
- project
the python script will create new folder if doesnt exist for those properties only


so now ASSOCIATION property. honestly probably the most important will by the thing that create our links into our second brain . so needs great structure and foundation to support us for **LIFE**


SO HOW IT WILL BE FOR NOW IS WHATEVER PARENT FOLDER THIS SHOULD LOCATED WE PLACE THE ASSOCIATION IN RELATION TO IT.

WHEN THE PYTHON SCRIPT RUNS
IT WILL RELOCATE THE NOTE INTO THE PROPER FOLDER BASED ON ASSOCIATION

ASSOCIATIONS CAN ONLY BE ON FILES SO ASSOCAITION CAN ONLY CORRELATE TO
- PROJECTS
- TASKS


CAN WE CREATE MILESTONE FOR GOALS 
	I GUES





### NEW ENTRY FOR LATER IN THE DAY


CRAZY WE CAN CREATE LIST OF ASSOCIATION SO THATS HOW IT WILL NEED TO WORK 
ASSOCIATION TO THE PROJECT + AREA

BECAUSE CURRENT SETUP FILE NEEDS TO BE A 2 PLACES AT ONCE ? IN PROJECTS + AREAS?


SO ONE SPACE OVERVIEW IS AREAS THEN PROJECTS INSIDE AREA FOLDERS THEN INSIDE TASKS?


WE NEED ASSOCIATION TO LINK BACK TO PARENT SOMEHOW



WHEN FREQUENCY IS BEING USED A NEW ENTRY IS CREATED FOR EACH WEEK
