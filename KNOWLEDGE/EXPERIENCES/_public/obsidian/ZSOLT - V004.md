        - Type and select "Excalidraw: Create a new drawing."
        - A new white drawing will be created by default.

        - Adjust the settings to start your drawing in dark mode, if preferred.
        - Add any initial objects or elements you want included in your template.
    3. **Save the Drawing as a Template:**
        - Name the drawing (e.g., "Template").
        - The drawing is created in the Excalidraw folder by default.
    4. **Configure Template Settings:**
        - Go to the settings in Obsidian.
        - Locate the Excalidraw plugin settings.
        - Set the folder for templates and specify the name of your template file (e.g., "Template").
    5. **Using the Template:**
        - From now on, when creating a new drawing, it will use the configured template.
        - This ensures that any new drawing starts with the predefined settings and elements.
