### Introduction to Excalidraw Sync

#### Overview:

- **Excalidraw Sync:**
    - A temporary workaround for syncing Excalidraw files across devices using Obsidian Sync.
    - Useful for working on drawings between devices like an iPad and a PC.

#### Setup:

- **Initial Setup:**
    - Ensure Obsidian is active on both your phone and desktop.
    - Enable Obsidian Sync on both devices.
    - Have your drawings ready in Excalidraw on your phone and desktop.

#### Enabling Sync:

1. **On the Desktop:**
    
    - Open Excalidraw settings.
    - Scroll down to the sync section and read the disclaimers.
    - Click "Sync" to enable Excalidraw Sync.
    - The plugin creates a folder named `xcolidrawsync` containing markdown files replicating your drawings.
    - **Important:** Do not alter files in this folder.
2. **On the Phone:**
    
    - Open Excalidraw settings.
    - Scroll down to the sync section.
    - Enable sync on your phone.

#### Sync Demonstration:

1. **Syncing Drawings:**
    
    - Once sync is enabled on both devices, all drawings from the phone will appear on the desktop and vice versa.
    - Example: A drawing made on the phone will now be visible on the desktop in the `xcolidrawsync` folder.
2. **Editing and Syncing Changes:**
    
    - **From Phone to Desktop:**
        - Open a drawing on your phone, make changes (e.g., color an area).
        - Save the drawing to sync changes to the desktop.
        - The desktop will reflect changes after a short delay or immediately upon force saving.
    - **From Desktop to Phone:**
        - Open a drawing on the desktop, make changes (e.g., draw an element).
        - Save the drawing to sync changes to the phone.
        - The phone will reflect changes after a short delay or immediately upon force saving.

#### Sync Behavior:

- **Auto-Sync Interval:**
    - The sync check occurs every 30 seconds.
    - Use the save button to force an immediate sync if needed.

#### Conclusion:

- **Usage and Troubleshooting:**
    - Excalidraw Sync is designed to work seamlessly, though minor issues may occur.
    - For any syncing delays, ensure you manually save to update across devices.
