### Obsidian Excalidraw Walkthrough: Part 8 - Templates

#### Introduction

Hey, welcome back! This is part eight of my walkthrough, and we're going to be looking at templates in Excalidraw. Let's dive into the different ways you can set up and use templates.

#### Creating a Simple Template

1. **Create a Template File:**
    
    - First, create a file and name it whatever you like.
    - Remember the file name and its location.
    - Example: My file is called `template` and it's located in `excalidraw/template`.
2. **Setting Up the Template:**
    
    - Open the template file and set your preferences.
        - Example settings:
            - Stroke color: Blue
            - Show grid by default
            - Text type: Coding
            - Dark mode: Enabled
    - Save the template file.
3. **Configuring the Template in Settings:**
    
    - Go to Obsidian settings.
    - Under Excalidraw settings, specify the location of your template file.
        - Example: `excalidraw/template`
4. **Using the Template:**
    
    - When you create a new drawing, it will automatically use the settings from your template.
        - Example: The new drawing will have a blue stroke color, coding text type, grid enabled, and dark mode.

#### Using Obsidian Core Templates Plugin

1. **Core Templates Plugin:**
    
    - Since Excalidraw files are markdown files, you can use the Obsidian core templates plugin to create and use templates.
    - This allows for an infinite number of templates beyond the single template offered by Excalidraw.
2. **Creating and Using Templates:**
    
    - Create a template in markdown.
    - Use the template to create new documents with pre-defined settings.
3. **Using Templater Plugin:**
    
    - If you use Templater or a similar engine, you can create templates with dynamic content.
    - Example: Automatically include today's date or version number in your drawings.
        - Modify the text elements in the markdown file with Templater code.
4. **Example:**
    
    markdown
    
    Copy code
    
    `- version: v1.0 - date: 2024-07-01`
