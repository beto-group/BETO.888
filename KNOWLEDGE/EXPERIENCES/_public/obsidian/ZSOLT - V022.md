### omplete Walkthrough of Obsidian Excalidraw

Hey, welcome to the complete walkthrough of Obsidian Excalidraw. I've done a couple of months of development on this plugin, and I thought it's time to have a proper, complete walkthrough updated with all the current features of the tool. This series of short videos is going to start with a getting started piece, which is this one. Then, I'll talk about some native Excalidraw features, embedding drawings into your documents, portability of your files, links in the drawings, block transclusions, markdown features, templating, the special template approach using Excalidraw Automate, and finally, some miscellaneous topics.

#### Getting Started

There are many ways to create a new drawing:

##### Creating a New Drawing

1. **Using the Command Palette:**
    
    - Open the command palette and type "Create a drawing".
    - Select "Create a drawing in a new pane".
    - A new drawing is created with an automatically generated file name.
2. **Using the Ribbon Button:**
    
    - Click the ribbon button to create a drawing in the active pane.
    - Control-click the ribbon button to create a new drawing in a new pane.
3. **Using the File Explorer:**
    
    - Right-click anywhere in the file explorer.
    - Select "New Excalidraw drawing".
    - Control-click to create the drawing in a new pane.
4. **Converting an Empty Note:**
    
    - Create a new markdown document (e.g., Untitled 1).
    - Open the command palette, type "Convert".
    - Select "Convert empty note to Excalidraw drawing".
    - The markdown document is converted into an Excalidraw drawing.

##### Folder and File Naming

1. **Default Folder:**
    
    - Drawings are saved to a predefined folder, typically the "Excalidraw" folder.
    - You can find all your drawings in this folder.
2. **Customizing Folder and File Naming:**
    
    - Go to settings for Excalidraw.
    - Specify a custom folder for your drawings.
    - Set a prefix for the file names.
    - Include the date in the file name.
    - For more details on date formatting, follow the provided link to the help page.
