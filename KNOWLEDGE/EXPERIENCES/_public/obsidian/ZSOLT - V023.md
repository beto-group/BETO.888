#### Undo and Redo Functionality

- **Observation**: The undo and redo function was missing while using my iPad.
- **Solution**: The Excalidraw team has built this functionality.
- **New Feature**: Included undo and redo buttons.
- **Demonstration**: You can now see these two buttons included in the new release, making it much easier to correct mistakes while drawing.

#### Improved PNG Export Quality

- **Observation**: PNG image exports were not of high enough quality for some uses.
- **Solution**: Added a setting to control PNG export quality.
- **New Feature**: "PNG Export Image Scale" setting to adjust the resolution of PNG exports.
- **Settings Path**: Go to "Embed and Export" to find this new option.
- **Demonstration**:
    - Adjust the scale to your desired value.
    - Click "Save as PNG to Vault".
    - Check the resulting PNG image in your vault to see the improved quality.

#### Full-Screen Support

- **Observation**: Full-screen functionality was missing, especially useful for desktop or laptop users.
- **New Feature**: Added full-screen support.
- **Demonstration**:
    - Click the full-screen button to expand Excalidraw to full screen.
    - Note that this feature is not available on mobile devices as it is not needed there.

#### Enhanced Link Handling

- **Observation**: Needed a better way to handle links in drawings.
- **Solution**: Implemented a "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) setup for links.
- **New Feature**: Improved handling of internal and external links.
- **Demonstration**:
    - Double-click a link to see it turn into its raw markdown content.
    - Edit the link as needed and finish editing to see it rendered again as a preview.
    - The lock button has been replaced with a preview mode and raw mode toggle.
- **Additional Information**: The preview mode (formerly locked mode) is more intelligent now, although some rough edges remain.

#### Hashtag Support

- **Observation**: Needed support for hashtags within drawings.
- **Solution**: Added hashtag support in text elements.
- **New Feature**: Icons and other elements can include text elements with hashtags.
- **Demonstration**:
    - Control-click a hashtag within a drawing.
    - The search will open up for that tag, displaying all related drawings.
    - Example: Light bulb icon with a hashtag in the drawings shows the search results for that tag when clicked.
