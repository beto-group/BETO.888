Introduction
This tutorial will guide you through creating custom columns and groupings to dynamically display and organize your game data using the DataCore plugin in Obsidian. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to create a customized table view of your game collection.
Prerequisites
Obsidian installed on your device
DataCore plugin installed and enabled in Obsidian
Basic knowledge of JavaScript and React concepts
Step 1: Define Your Data Columns
First, we'll create custom columns to display specific game attributes.
jsx
const COLUMNS = [
    { id: "Game", value: (game) => game.$link },
    { id: "Time Played", value: (game) => game.value("time played") ?? game.value("time-played") },
    { id: "Length", value: (game) => game.value("length") },
    { id: "Tags", value: (game) => game.$tags.filter(t => t.startsWith("#game/")).join(" ") },
    { id: "Rating", value: (game) => game.value("rating") }
];

In this step, we're defining an array of column objects. Each object has an id (the column name) and a value function that retrieves data from the game object.
Step 2: Create a Grouping Function
Now, let's create a function to group our games by year.
jsx
function YearGroup(year, rows) {
    return <dc.Group justify="space-between" align="center">
        <h2>{year}</h2>
        <span>{rows.length} entries</span>
    </dc.Group>;
}

This function creates a group header for each year, showing the year and the number of games played in that year.
Step 3: Apply the Grouping to Your Table
Finally, we'll apply our YearGroup function to the table.

```
	jsx
	const GROUPINGS = { render: YearGroup };
	
This sets up our table to use the YearGroup function for grouping games.
Step 4: Putting It All Together
Now, let's use these components to create our DataCore view:
jsx
<dc.DataviewTable
    data={dv.pages('#game').where(p => p["status"] == "completed")}
    columns={COLUMNS}
    groupBy={p => p.value("completed-date").year}
    groupings={GROUPINGS}
/>
```
This creates a table of completed games, using our custom columns and year grouping.
Conclusion
You've now created a custom view for your game data using DataCore. Experiment with different columns and groupings to customize your view further.
Next Steps
Try creating different grouping functions (e.g., by genre or rating)

Consider how you might use this approach for other types of data in your Obsidian vault

### **Tutorial 2: Adding a Search and Filter Box**

This tutorial will help you implement a dynamic search filter, allowing users to find specific games by name.

#### Step 1: Set Up the Search Box State

Initialize a search state to hold the search term entered by the user.

jsx

Copy code

`const [nameFilter, setNameFilter] = dc.useState("");`

#### Step 2: Create the Search Box Component

Add a `dc.Textbox` for filtering the games. This component allows users to input text to filter the displayed data.

jsx

Copy code

`<dc.Group id="search-controls" justify="end">     <dc.Textbox type="search" placeholder="Filter..." width="600px"          onChange={e => setNameFilter(e.target.value)} /> </dc.Group>`

- **Explanation**: This input updates the `nameFilter` whenever the user types in the search box.
- **UI Interaction**: The wide search box offers an intuitive way for users to search for specific games.

#### Step 3: Filter Games Based on Search Term

Use the `nameFilter` to filter the displayed games dynamically.

jsx

Copy code

`const filteredGames = games.where(x => nameFilter === "" ? true : x.$name.toLowerCase().includes(nameFilter.toLowerCase()));`

- **Explanation**: This code compares the name of each game with the search term and filters out games that don’t match.
- **Scalability**: The filtering logic can easily be extended to other attributes like tags or rating.

### **Tutorial 3: Normalizing Data for "Time Played"**

This tutorial will guide you through ensuring that your system handles different data formats for the "time played" attribute.

#### Step 1: Create the Time Played Function

Write a function that normalizes the data, supporting multiple possible field names (e.g., "time played", "time-played").

jsx

Copy code

`function timePlayed(input) {     let raw = input.value("time played") ?? input.value("time-played");     while (Array.isArray(raw)) raw = raw[0];  // Handle arrays          if (typeof raw === "string") return undefined;  // Avoid returning strings     return raw; }`

- **Explanation**: This function checks for the "time played" field, handles arrays, and avoids string values.
- **Flexibility**: This method ensures that the system can handle various data formats, making the code future-proof.

#### Step 2: Apply the Time Played Function in Filtering

Incorporate this function to filter or sort the games based on the time played.

jsx

Copy code

`const sortedGames = games.sort(x => timePlayed(x), 'desc');`

- **Explanation**: This code sorts the games by the normalized "time played" value in descending order.
- **Scalability**: The same approach can be applied to other attributes like game length or ratings.

### **Tutorial 4: Embedding Blocks Dynamically**

This tutorial shows how to render blocks that are tagged with specific labels, dynamically embedding their content.

#### Step 1: Query Tagged Blocks

Use `dc.useQuery` to retrieve blocks that are tagged with a specific label (e.g., `#tagged`).

jsx

Copy code

``const blocks = dc.useQuery(`@block and #tagged`);``

- **Explanation**: This query searches for all blocks tagged with `#tagged`, preparing them for display.
- **Future Applications**: This method can be expanded to search for other tags, allowing for modular content rendering.

#### Step 2: Embed the Blocks into the View

Use `dc.SpanEmbed` to embed the content of the retrieved blocks into your UI.

jsx

Copy code

`return (     <div>         {blocks.map(block => (             <dc.SpanEmbed path={block.$file} start={block.$position.start} end={block.$position.end} />         ))}     </div> );`

- **Explanation**: This component takes the file and block position, embedding the corresponding content into the UI.
- **Potential for Expansion**: The system can scale to include more complex block-level integrations or additional tag filters.

### **Tutorial 5: Guarding Initialization for Stable Rendering**

This tutorial ensures that the UI components are not rendered until the Datacore environment is fully initialized.

#### Step 1: Implement a Guard

Ensure that no components are rendered prematurely by introducing a guard mechanism.

jsx

Copy code

`if (!dc.isInitialized()) return null;`

- **Explanation**: This prevents rendering before the Datacore environment is ready, avoiding potential errors.
- **Performance Stability**: This will improve the system’s performance during loading, especially in complex environments.

---

### **Advanced Future Tutorials (Hints)**

- **Handling Larger Datasets**: As your system grows, consider implementing more advanced pagination and indexing methods to maintain performance. Upcoming Datacore beta updates will improve this, allowing for more **canvas indexing** and **task-view styles**.
- **Expanding Filter Options**: Future enhancements could include filters for ratings, game genres, or even user-specific tags, unlocking higher levels of customization and interaction.
