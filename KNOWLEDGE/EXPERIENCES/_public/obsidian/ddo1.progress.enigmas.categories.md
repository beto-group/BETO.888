## 1. **System Architecture and Core Functionalities**

## 1.2. **Custom Rendering and Block-Level Search**

- **Game Data Display**: Custom columns and groupings, such as year-based groupings, provide a refined data display[](https://www.datacore.com/products/sansymphony/).
- **Rendering Enhancements**: The rendering system supports **tagged blocks**, allowing users to embed content based on block IDs. This enhances modularity and reuse of document sections[](https://www.datacore.com/products/sansymphony/).
- **Interactive Views**: The system provides **interactive filtering** and **sorting** based on parameters like "time played" and game tags. These views aim to simplify the representation of large data sets within the UI[](https://www.datacore.com/products/sansymphony/).

## 1.3. **Complex Querying and Data Manipulation**

- **Dynamic Schema for Nested Structures**: The system can handle complex data structures, including nested arrays, as demonstrated by the `timePlayed` function[](https://www.datacore.com/products/sansymphony/).
- **Task Sorting and Filtering**: Complex query conditions (e.g., sorting games by time played and grouping by year) allow for more flexible and dynamic data manipulation[](https://www.datacore.com/products/sansymphony/).

## 1.4. **Planned System Features**

- **Future Work**: Upcoming betas will include task-view styles and improvements to canvas indexing, optimizing performance and introducing new features[](https://www.datacore.com/products/sansymphony/).

## 2. **User Interaction, Task Management, and UI Enhancements**

## 2.2. **UI Component Development**

- **Interactive Tables**: The system uses custom components like `dc.VanillaTable` for displaying data, supporting features such as grouping, custom column definitions, and pagination[](https://www.datacore.com/products/sansymphony/).
- **Search Functionality**: A search box (`dc.Textbox`) is integrated to allow users to filter data dynamically[](https://www.datacore.com/products/sansymphony/).

## 2.3. **Handling Large Data Sets**

- **Efficient Pagination**: The table view implements paging (set to 12 rows per page in the example), improving the handling of large datasets[](https://www.datacore.com/products/sansymphony/).
- **Search Filtering**: A dynamic search filter enables users to rapidly filter games based on name, streamlining large-scale data management[](https://www.datacore.com/products/sansymphony/).

## 3. **Performance, Automation, and Community Contributions**

## 3.1. **Performance Benchmarks and Improvements**

- **Guard for Initialization**: A safeguard has been implemented to ensure Datacore is fully initialized before rendering views, preventing errors during page load[](https://www.datacore.com/products/sansymphony/).

## 3.2. **Automation and Workflow Enhancements**

- **Beta Releases**: Recent beta versions (0.1.12 and 0.1.15) have reintroduced direct field querying in expressions (e.g., `rating >= 8`), enhancing data filtering capabilities[](https://www.datacore.com/products/sansymphony/).
