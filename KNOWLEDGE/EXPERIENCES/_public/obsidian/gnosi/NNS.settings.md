## Technical Report: NNS Plugin Settings Implementation

### Overview

The NNS (Nisaba Nexus Synthesis) plugin connects Obsidian to various AI models offered by multiple providers. Providers may include remote services like OpenAI and Anthropic as well as local or custom-deployed AI solutions. Because each provider can offer different language models (LLMs) with different costs, quality, and performance, the settings system must be flexible, dynamic, and user‑friendly. It must support both simple global defaults for general users and advanced options for developers who want fine‑grained control.

### Key Requirements

1. **Centralized Provider Management**  
    **What It Means:**  
    • The plugin maintains a centralized settings object that stores configuration for all AI providers.  
    • Each provider has its own entry containing the provider’s name, connection URL, authentication credentials, and a dynamic list of available models.  
    **Why It Matters:**  
    • Users can choose which provider to use for their AI requests.  
    • Providers are managed uniformly, and adding or updating a provider does not require changing the core system.
    
2. **Authentication and Connection Validation**  
    **What It Means:**  
    • Every provider—whether remote or local—requires an API key (or token) to connect.  
    • A “Test Connection” feature checks that the entered API key and endpoint are valid and fetches the current list of available models.  
    **Why It Matters:**  
    • Before any AI request is made, the plugin must confirm that the credentials work.  
    • Dynamic validation ensures that users see up‑to‑date model offerings and prevents misconfiguration.
    
3. **Dynamic Model Retrieval**  
    **What It Means:**  
    • Rather than hardcoding a list of LLMs for each provider, the plugin dynamically fetches available models from the provider’s server when the connection is tested.  
    **Why It Matters:**  
    • When providers release new models or update existing ones, the plugin automatically reflects these changes without needing code updates.
    
4. **Dual Default Model Selections (High‑Complexity vs. Economy)**  
    **What It Means:**  
    • For each provider, users can select two default models:   – A “Best Reasoning” model for high‑quality, complex tasks.   – An “Economy” model for simpler tasks where cost is a key factor. **Why It Matters:**  
    • This allows cost control without sacrificing quality when needed. • When a high‑complexity request is forced, if the primary provider fails, only a backup high‑complexity model is used rather than falling back to a cheaper option.
    
5. **Global Defaults and Fallback Options**  
    **What It Means:**  
    • A global default provider is defined (e.g., “OpenAI”), along with a backup provider (e.g., “Anthropic”) used if the primary fails.  
    • In general use, the system uses these global defaults; advanced users can override these on a per‑request basis. **Why It Matters:**  
    • Ensures that AI requests are handled smoothly even if one provider’s service is unavailable. • Allows forced selections for specialized scenarios while maintaining a robust default behavior.
    
6. **Local Deployment Support**  
    **What It Means:**  
    • Local AI models (deployed on a user’s server or computer) are treated as providers with their own endpoints and authentication.  
    **Why It Matters:**  
    • Users who run their own LLMs can integrate them into the same settings system as remote providers. • The dynamic model fetching and dual default selections apply to local deployments as well.
    
7. **Additional Enhancements from Feedback**
    
    - **Granular Cost Control:**  
        • Allow users to set spending limits per provider or even per model.  
        • Display estimated costs before a request is sent and alert users when nearing limits.
        
    - **Model Capabilities Matrix:**  
        • Provide a simple table (or matrix) that compares key model characteristics (context window size, cutoff date, performance metrics) to help users make informed choices.  
        • If available, this information can be fetched dynamically from the provider.
        
    - **Error Handling and Asynchronous Operations:**  
        • Clearly anticipate errors (e.g., invalid API key, network failures, rate limiting).  
        • Display user-friendly error messages and guidance.  
        • Use asynchronous operations with progress indicators (spinners, visual cues) so that model fetching or connection testing does not block the UI.
        
    - **Security Considerations:**  
        • API keys are sensitive. They should be stored securely (for example, using encryption at rest) and handled according to best practices.
        
    - **UI/UX Enhancements:**  
        • Visual cues (such as color coding) should indicate the status of a provider (connected, disconnected, error).  
        • Tooltips or help text should explain each setting.  
        • If many models are available, include search or filtering in dropdowns.  
        • Consider an import/export feature so users can back up or share settings.
        
    - **Provider-Specific Extensibility:**  
        • Allow additional, provider-specific settings (like temperature or max tokens for OpenAI) via an extensible settings field.  
        • A flexible “settings” property can be added to each provider’s configuration.
        
    - **Versioning and Updates:**  
        • Include a version number for the settings schema to allow for migrations and updates.
        
    - **Testing and Documentation:**  
        • A clear testing strategy (unit and integration tests) and comprehensive documentation are essential for ongoing support and future improvements.
        
    - **Rate Limiting and Request Context:**  
        • The system should handle provider rate limits (with features like automatic retries using exponential backoff).  
        • It can also allow extra context to be attached to requests (for example, user role or project details) to aid in debugging and provide context for the AI.



### Summary of Benefits

- **Centralized Management:**  
    All providers (remote and local) are configured in a single settings object. Users can easily set up connection details and see updated model lists.
    
- **Authentication and Dynamic Retrieval:**  
    Each provider requires an API key and an endpoint, which are validated using a “Test Connection” feature that also retrieves the current model offerings.
    
- **Dual Default Selections:**  
    Two default models are selectable per provider—one for high‑complexity (best reasoning) tasks and one for economy tasks—providing flexibility in balancing quality and cost.
    
- **Global and Forced Modes:**  
    The system supports both a global default (with backup options) for general use and the ability for advanced users or developers to force specific provider–model combinations.
    
- **Local Deployment Support:**  
    Local AI models are integrated using the same dynamic retrieval and validation process as remote providers, ensuring consistency.
    
- **Additional Enhancements:**  
    The design considers granular cost control, a model capabilities matrix, robust error handling, asynchronous operations with progress indicators, secure key storage, enhanced UI/UX (tooltips, visual cues, filtering, import/export), provider-specific extensibility, versioning, testing strategies, rate limiting, and request context management.
