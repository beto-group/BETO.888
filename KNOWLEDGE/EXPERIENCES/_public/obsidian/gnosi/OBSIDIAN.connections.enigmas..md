#### Importance of Connections

- **Purpose:** Note-to-note links create weak ties within the slip-box, leading to powerful insights.
- **Outcome:** Linking notes regardless of their context or location sparks new lines of thought and insights.
- **Benefit:** Helps find connections and similarities between seemingly unrelated topics, revealing patterns.
