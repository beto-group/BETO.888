For handling massive vaults, where performance and efficient loading are crucial, both Hugo and Jekyll have different strengths, but here's how they compare and how you can enhance the experience by manipulating content loading:

Performance Comparison for Large Sites:

1. Hugo:

Speed: Hugo is renowned for its build speed, especially when dealing with large volumes of content. It compiles static sites incredibly fast because it is written in Go, which is optimized for performance. This makes Hugo a better choice for massive vaults where you need quick build times.

Efficient Templating: Hugo's templating system is efficient, and you can easily create partials and shortcodes that allow for the reuse of templates, keeping things lightweight.

Data Files: Hugo can handle structured data (YAML, JSON, TOML) alongside Markdown, which can help in organizing metadata or creating additional dynamic content features that load quickly.

Incremental Builds: Though Hugo does not natively support incremental builds like some other static site generators, its fast build times usually compensate for this.



2. Jekyll:

Speed: Jekyll is slower in comparison, especially when dealing with a large number of files. Since it is Ruby-based, the build process can be more time-consuming, making it less suitable for extremely large vaults without optimizations.

Plugins: Jekyll has a robust plugin ecosystem that allows for extended functionality, but heavy use of plugins can further slow down builds. However, plugins can help customize the site to load content dynamically or handle massive amounts of data better.

Incremental Builds: Jekyll does support incremental builds, which can improve build times during development, though the feature is not perfect and might not be as reliable for very large projects.




Manipulating Content Loading for Improved User Experience:

To enhance user experience on both Hugo and Jekyll sites, especially for large vaults, consider implementing lazy loading and progressive enhancement techniques:

1. Lazy Loading Content:

Load Critical Content First: Ensure that the primary content (like the homepage, navigation, or hero section) loads immediately. Other parts of the site, such as heavy graphs, images, or less critical pages, can be lazy-loaded. This means these elements will only load when they come into the viewport or are required.

Using JavaScript for Lazy Loading: Implement libraries such as Lazysizes for images or IntersectionObserver for content sections to defer loading:

<img data-src="image.jpg" class="lazyload" alt="example">
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lazysizes/5.3.0/lazysizes.min.js"></script>

Pagination and Infinite Scrolling: Instead of loading all pages at once, break down content into smaller chunks (pagination) or use infinite scrolling to load more content as the user scrolls down. This can keep the initial load fast and improve user experience.



2. Progressive Enhancement:

Static First, Dynamic Later: Build the core of your site as static, and enhance it with JavaScript. This allows the main content to be fully accessible and navigable while additional elements (like graphs and additional data points) can load asynchronously. Use frameworks like Alpine.js or Vanilla JavaScript to handle these dynamic updates without heavy frameworks.

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): Use CDNs to serve static assets, which can significantly speed up the delivery of your site content. Platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or Cloudflare Pages can handle this effectively and often integrate well with both Hugo and Jekyll.



3. Deferred JavaScript Execution:

Script Defer or Async: Ensure that any non-critical JavaScript files are loaded asynchronously. This can prevent blocking the rendering of essential content.

<script src="script.js" defer></script>




Additional Tips:

Service Workers and Caching: For frequently accessed pages, implement service workers that can cache important parts of your site, providing instant load times for returning visitors.

Pre-rendering Critical Paths: Identify the main navigation paths that users are likely to take and pre-render these paths to improve perceived performance. This ensures that users feel the site is responsive, even if additional content is still being processed in the background.


Conclusion:

For a massive vault, Hugo is generally the better choice due to its faster build times and efficient handling of static content. By leveraging lazy loading, progressive enhancement, and deferred JavaScript execution, you can significantly improve the performance and user experience of your site, ensuring that users can start interacting with the main content immediately while the rest of the data loads in the background. These strategies can be applied effectively whether you're using Hugo or Jekyll, but Hugo's inherent speed will give you a head start.




# HOW-TO
JEKELL + DENO + PREACT

To serve up the TSX/JSX component you provided within a Jekyll environment, ensuring it mimics the interaction and data flow like Obsidian’s Datacore, you'll need to integrate Deno for TypeScript processing, set up your data fetching, and utilize React for rendering the UI components. Here's how to get this set up step-by-step:

Step 1: Prepare Your Jekyll Environment

1. Install Jekyll:

Make sure you have Ruby, Jekyll, and Bundler installed:

gem install jekyll bundler
jekyll new my-cookbook-site
cd my-cookbook-site



2. Modify _config.yml:

Configure your Jekyll project to include plugins and data settings:

plugins:
  - jekyll-feed
  - jekyll-seo-tag
  - jekyll-sitemap
collections:
  recipes:
    output: true
    permalink: /recipes/:path/




Step 2: Set Up Deno for TypeScript Processing

1. Create the Deno Environment:

In your project directory, create a deno folder:

mkdir deno
cd deno



2. Write a Deno Script to Convert Markdown Data:

Create a script that processes your Obsidian-like Markdown files into a JSON format:

// deno/convertToData.ts
import { readTextFile, writeTextFile } from "https://deno.land/std@0.114.0/fs/mod.ts";

interface Recipe {
  name: string;
  source: string;
  genre: string;
  tags: string[];
  ingredients: string[];
  ctime: string;
}

async function parseMarkdownToData() {
  const markdown = await readTextFile("../vault/recipes/recipe.md");
  // Assuming metadata parsing and Markdown processing happen here
  const data: Recipe = {
    name: "Spaghetti Carbonara",
    source: "Family Cookbook",
    genre: "Italian",
    tags: ["pasta", "comfort food"],
    ingredients: ["spaghetti", "eggs", "bacon", "parmesan"],
    ctime: new Date().toISOString()
  };
  await writeTextFile("../_data/recipes.json", JSON.stringify(data));
}

parseMarkdownToData();

Execute this script:

deno run --allow-read --allow-write deno/convertToData.ts




Step 3: Use TSX/JSX in Jekyll with Deno

1. Create TSX Components:

Use Deno to process and compile TypeScript + JSX components into JavaScript. First, install Preact for compatibility:

// src/components/ColumnManager.tsx
import { h, Fragment } from "https://esm.sh/preact";
import { useState } from "https://esm.sh/preact/hooks";

export function ColumnManager({ columns, onSetColumns }) {
  const [selectedColumns, setSelectedColumns] = useState(columns);

  function handleChange(event) {
    const value = event.target.value;
    setSelectedColumns([...selectedColumns, value]);
    onSetColumns(selectedColumns);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <label>Manage Columns:</label>
      <select multiple onChange={handleChange}>
        {selectedColumns.map((col) => (
          <option value={col}>{col}</option>
        ))}
      </select>
    </div>
  );
}



2. Bundle Your TypeScript with Deno:

Use Deno’s bundling to create a single JavaScript file:

deno bundle src/components/ColumnManager.tsx assets/js/column-manager-bundle.js



3. Integrate the JavaScript into Jekyll:

Modify the Jekyll layout file to include your JavaScript:

<!-- _layouts/default.html -->
<html>
<head>
  <script src="/assets/js/column-manager-bundle.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="column-manager-container"></div>
  {{ content }}
</body>
</html>




Step 4: Data Integration - Mimicking Datacore

1. Setting Up Data Retrieval:

Assuming you have recipes in a JSON format, your component should dynamically fetch this data:

// src/index.tsx
import { h, render } from "https://esm.sh/preact";
import { useState, useEffect } from "https://esm.sh/preact/hooks";
import { ColumnManager } from "./components/ColumnManager.tsx";

function App() {
  const [recipes, setRecipes] = useState([]);
  const [columns, setColumns] = useState(["Recipes", "Source", "Tags"]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("/_data/recipes.json")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => setRecipes(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <ColumnManager columns={columns} onSetColumns={setColumns} />
      {recipes.map((recipe) => (
        <div>{recipe.name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

render(<App />, document.getElementById("column-manager-container"));



2. Processing and Displaying Recipes:

The ColumnManager can now dynamically handle the columns you wish to display, and the main App will render recipes based on JSON data that mirrors what Datacore might provide.




Step 5: Automate Deno and Jekyll Workflow

1. Automate Data Processing:

Use deno task scripts to automate running Deno jobs before Jekyll builds:

{
  "scripts": {
    "build-data": "deno run --allow-read --allow-write deno/convertToData.ts",
    "build-js": "deno bundle src/index.tsx assets/js/bundle.js",
    "build-all": "deno task build-data && deno task build-js && jekyll build"
  }
}



2. Deploy Efficiently:

Once everything is bundled and processed, deploy your Jekyll site to GitHub Pages or Netlify. Make sure all data (_data/recipes.json) and JS bundles are included in your repository for the final site build.




Conclusion:

By leveraging Deno and TSX/JSX within a Jekyll environment, you can create a dynamic setup that closely mimics how Obsidian’s Datacore handles data, presenting an efficient and interactive experience. Through structured data processing and reactive components, your Jekyll site can serve data-rich content that updates dynamically, driven by front-end JS compiled from Deno-managed TypeScript.
