## üöÄ Quick Start & Installation
**Prerequisites:** You must have the Obsidian.md application installed on your device. Git is optional.

There are two ways to install this vault. Choose the one that suits you best.

#### Method 1: Direct Download (Simple & Quick)
This is the easiest method if you don't use Git.

1.  **Download the ZIP file:**
    - Go to the top of the repository page: [https://github.com/BETO-GROUP/BETO.888](https://github.com/BETO-GROUP/BETO.888)
    - Click the green `<> Code` button.
    - Select `Download ZIP`.

2.  **Unzip the folder:**
    - Find the downloaded `.zip` file on your computer and unzip it.
    - This will create a folder named `BETO.888-main`. You can rename it to just `BETO.888` for simplicity.

3.  **Open in Obsidian:**
    - Launch the Obsidian application.
    - Click on "Open another vault" (the vault icon in the left-hand ribbon).
    - Select "Open folder as vault".
    - Navigate to the folder you just unzipped (`BETO.888-main` or `BETO.888`) and select it.

---

#### Method 2: Using Git (Recommended for updates)
This method uses Git to clone the repository. The main advantage is that it's much easier to get future updates.

1.  **Clone the Vault:**
    - Make sure you have Git installed.
    - Open your computer's terminal (or Command Prompt / PowerShell on Windows) and run the following command. This will download the repository into a new `BETO.888` folder.
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/BETO-GROUP/BETO.888
    ```

2.  **Open in Obsidian:**
    - Launch the Obsidian application.
    - Click on "Open another vault".
    - Select "Open folder as vault".
    - Navigate to the `BETO.888` folder you just cloned and select it.
