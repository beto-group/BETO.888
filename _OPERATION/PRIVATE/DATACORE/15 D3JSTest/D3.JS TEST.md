### Tab: D3.js Test

- **Description**: A basic demonstration component that uses the popular D3.js library to render a simple, static bar chart from a hardcoded dataset.
    
- **Does**:
    
    - Dynamically loads the D3.js library (v7) from a CDN if it's not already available in the environment.
    - Renders an SVG-based bar chart using the loaded D3 library.
    - Correctly defines and displays X and Y axes based on the data.
    - Serves as a working proof-of-concept for how to integrate and use D3.js within a component.
        
- **Canâ€™t**:
    
    - The data for the chart is hardcoded as a simple array; it cannot visualize data from a Datacore query or any other dynamic source.
    - The chart is not interactive (no tooltips on hover, no zooming, no filtering).
    - The chart's appearance (colors, size, margins) is fixed within the code.
    - Requires an internet connection to download the D3.js library on its first use.
