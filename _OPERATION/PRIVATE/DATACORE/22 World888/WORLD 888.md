- **Description**: An expansive, physics-enabled 3D world built with Babylon.js and the Havok physics engine. It serves as a sophisticated sandbox featuring a multiplayer-ready first-person character, dynamic scene loading, and interactive elements.

- **Does**:
   
    - Renders a large, complex 3D scene loaded from a local .glb file, complete with orbiting and hovering animated elements.
    - Implements a full first-person character controller with advanced movement mechanics, including sprinting, crouching, and physics-based sliding.
    - Utilizes the Havok physics engine to apply realistic collisions and physics to the character and all objects in the environment.
    - Features a local multiplayer system using BroadcastChannel, allowing multiple instances of the view to see each other's characters move in real-time.
    - Allows the player to click on interactive spheres in the world to spawn other Datacore components in new picture-in-picture windows.
        
- **Can’t**:
    
    - The world geometry and initial character position are hardcoded; it cannot load different levels or starting points without code changes.
    - Multiplayer functionality is local to the user's machine (via BroadcastChannel) and does not work over a network.
    - The physics simulation is complex and may impact performance, especially with many objects.
    - Requires an internet connection to download its core libraries (Babylon.js, Havok).
