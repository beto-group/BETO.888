### Tab: Canvas v1

- **Description**: An infinite, zoomable canvas that acts as a freeform visual workspace, allowing you to place and arrange not only basic shapes but also other live Datacore components.
    
- **Does**:
    
    - Offers an infinite, pannable, and zoomable canvas with a dynamic background grid.
    - Dynamically embeds other live Datacore components onto the canvas, turning them into movable and resizable windows.
    - Allows creating and arranging various objects: text boxes, circles, triangles, and other shapes.
    - Supports full object manipulation including multi-selection (click, marquee), moving, resizing, deleting, and clipboard actions (copy/cut/paste).
    - Features a property editor to customize object attributes like color, opacity, and text labels.
    - Saves and loads the entire canvas state (objects, position, zoom) to and from JSON files within the vault.
    - Includes a lock mode to prevent accidental changes and a dark/light theme toggle.
        
- **Canâ€™t**:
    
    - Does not support connecting objects with lines or arrows.
    - Object layering is based on selection order; there is no manual "send to back" or "bring to front" control.
    - Embedding other components creates a dependency; if a source component is moved or broken, the canvas view for that object will also break.
    - Performance may degrade when rendering a large number of complex embedded components.
