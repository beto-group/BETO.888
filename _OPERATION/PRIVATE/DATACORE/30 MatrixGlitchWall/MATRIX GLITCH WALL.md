### Tab: MatrixGlitchWall

- **Description**: A visual effect component that renders a full-screen, animated wall of "glitching" characters, reminiscent of the "digital rain" from The Matrix.
    
- **Does**:
    
    - Fills its container with a grid of characters drawn from a custom set of cuneiform and other symbols.
        
    - Continuously and randomly updates characters in the grid at a configurable speed, creating an animated "glitch" or "data wall" effect.
        
    - Smoothly transitions the color of changing characters for a more fluid and less jarring visual.
        
    - Applies a vignette effect around the edges to focus the viewer's attention on the center.
        
    - Is fully responsive, automatically recalculating its grid size to adapt to any container dimensions.
        
- **Can’t**:
    
    - Display any user-provided text; it only shows the random, built-in character set.
        
    - Be interacted with; it is a purely decorative, non-interactive background effect.
        
    - Be configured (e.g., change colors, character set, speed) without editing the component's props in the code.
