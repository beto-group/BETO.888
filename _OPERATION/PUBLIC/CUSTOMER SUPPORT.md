# **BETO.GROUP Licensing Guide**

Welcome! This guide explains the simple and permissive licensing for all BETO.GROUP software "Releases" (the Obsidian vaults, code, and content we provide). Our goal is to give you maximum freedom to build, create, and share.

**Note:** This guide clarifies the official license terms. The full, legally binding license is provided in each Release and is consistent with **Section 1 of our Terms of Service**.

## **1. Our Core Licensing Model: Simple and Permissive**

All software released by BETO.GROUP is licensed under one of the most popular and flexible open-source licenses available: the **MIT License**.

- **What does this mean?** It means you have our permission, free of charge, to do almost anything you want with the software, as long as you follow one simple rule.
    
- **Is it always MIT?** Yes. There are no time limits, no transitions to other licenses, and no complex conditions. It's MIT from day one, forever.

## **2. What the MIT License Lets You Do**

The MIT License grants you broad freedom. Here are some of the most common things you are free to do:

- ✅ **Use it for anything.** Personal projects, university research, your company's internal tools, or even a commercial product you sell.
    
- ✅ **Make it your own.** Modify the code, change the templates, and adapt the structure to fit your exact needs.
    
- ✅ **Share it with others.** You can freely distribute the original Release or your modified versions of it.
    
- ✅ **Incorporate it into your own work.** You can build your own larger projects ("Derivative Works") on top of our Releases and license your original additions however you wish.

## **3. Your Single Responsibility: Give Credit**

The freedom of the MIT license comes with just one requirement: **attribution**.

When you distribute copies or substantial portions of a BETO.GROUP Release, you **must include the original BETO.GROUP copyright notice and the full text of the MIT License.**

That's it. This simple act of giving credit is the foundation of the trust that makes open-source software thrive.

## **4. How to State the License in YOUR Derivative Work**

When you create your own project (a "Derivative Work") using our components, the MIT license requires you to provide proper attribution. This is a crucial step. A common point of confusion is how to handle copyright notices.

Your project will have its **own copyright** for the new work you've created, and it **must also preserve our original copyright notice**. Think of it as a layered credit: you get credit for your additions, and we get credit for the original foundation you built upon.

Here are our recommended methods for correctly stating the license in your project.

### **Method 1: The LICENSE File (Recommended Best Practice)**

This is the clearest and most legally robust method. Create a LICENSE or LICENSE.md file in the root directory of your project and use the following template. This file should contain the full license text and all applicable copyright notices.

**Instructions:**

1. Create a file named LICENSE in your project's main folder.
    
2. Copy and paste the entire text from the code block below into that file.
    
3. Replace [Year] and [Your Name or Your Company's Name] with your own information.

## The MIT License

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.
```


This method is highly recommended as it fulfills all license obligations in one clear, standard location.

### **Method 2: README Acknowledgement (Good, but not a replacement)**

In addition to the main LICENSE file, it is a great community practice to give credit in your project's README.md file. This provides a user-friendly acknowledgement of the tools you used.

You can add a section like this to your README.md:

```
