### *1. About BETO.GROUP & Our Philosophy**

>[!info]- **Q: What is BETO.GROUP?**
>BETO.GROUP is an evolving digital ecosystem designed to explore ideas, foster learning, and empower your creative journey, primarily through our Obsidian Vaults and associated tools. We see it as a "war of ideas" where ancient echoes meet modern ingenuity, a space for discovery and innovation. Our core principle is "Nullius in verba"â€”we prove our commitment through actions, not just words.

>[!info]- **Q: What do you mean by "War of Ideas"?**
>For us, the "War of Ideas" represents the dynamic process of exploring, challenging, and refining concepts. It's about the creative struggle and intellectual curiosity that leads to new insights and understanding. Our platform is designed to be a crucible for this process.

>[!info]- **Q: Who is behind BETO.GROUP?**
>Currently, BETO.GROUP is primarily a one-person show. This means it's a labor of love, constantly evolving. Your feedback and understanding are invaluable as we grow!

>[!info]- **Q: Is BETO.GROUP powered by AI?**
>We playfully say it's "AI-ish hehe ðŸ«¡." While we leverage modern tools and thinking, the core curation, design, and philosophy are human-driven. AI might assist in some processes, but the vision and direction are distinctly ours.

### **2. Understanding Our Terminology (Methodology)**

>[!info]- **Q: You use a lot of unique terms like ENIGMAS, ZU, NAMZU, etc. What do they mean?**
> - [[ENIGMAS]]: Our repository of raw, unfiltered ideas and inspirations before they're refined. It's the messy start of innovation.
>  - [[NAMZU]]: The core essence or unifying spirit that underpins and gives identity to every category on our platform.
>   - [[ETHR]]: Our dynamic, fluid framework for organizing knowledge, merging explanation, exploration, and reference into an evolving narrative.
>    - [[SUD]]: The domain of subtle connections, revealing hidden relationships and synergies between diverse ideas.
>    - [[PARAGOGI]]: Our living gallery of creative ventures and ongoing experimental projects.
>    - [[NARU]]: Our visual ledger, a repository for images and social echoes that add depth and personal context.
>    - [[ZU]]: Our reservoir for learning, where we collect materials and inspirations for deeper exploration and intellectual growth.
>    - [[UN]]: Our external network, connecting our internal explorations with the broader digital community and dialogues.
>
>CHECK OUT [[WHAT DO WE DO Â¿ = A-NA I-AK E-NE ?]] FOR MORE INFO

>[!info]- **Q: Why this specific terminology?**
>This lexicon helps us structure our "war of ideas" and provides a unique framework for discovery and creation. Each term invites you to explore different layers of our ecosystem and, hopefully, your own creative potential.

### **3. The Obsidian Vault & Its Content**

>[!info]- **Q: What is the "BETO.888 Obsidian Vault"?**
>The BETO.GROUP Obsidian Vault is our primary offering. It's an ever-evolving collection of tools, our unique "enigmas" (exploratory content on diverse topics), datacore components for Obsidian, an assets library, and our embeddedÂ [[LICENSE GUIDE]]Â andÂ [[FAQ.enigma]], all designed to empower your Obsidian experience and aid your personal journey of discovery.

>[!info]- **Q: What do I get when I download a Vault Release?**
>Â Each Vault Release typically includes:
> - A collection of "enigmas" for exploration.
> - A series of "datacore components" to enhance your Obsidian use.
> - An assets library with visuals for your projects.
> - EmbeddedÂ [[LICENSE GUIDE]]Â andÂ [[FAQ.enigma]]Â notes.
> - AÂ [[CHANGE LOG]]Â detailing the release date and updates.
>
>[BONUS]Â We may occasionally offer access to future benefits or discounts to users of our Releases, but this is at our discretion.

>[!info]- **Q: How often is the Vault updated?**
>We aim to release a new version of the Obsidian Vault monthly. Each new version is a distinct "Release" under our Terms of Service and has its own "Date of Availability" which is important for licensing (see Section 4 below).

>[!info]- **Q: How do I use the Vault?**
>We suggest starting with the Bookmark Section (usually on the left panel in Obsidian) to find major categories. You can also explore topics using our internal navigation systems (details within the vault) and delve into our "METHODOLOGY" to better understand the structure.

>[!info]- **Q: Is the Vault still a "Work in Progress"? Should I expect bugs?**
>Yes, absolutely! BETO.GROUP is an experimental and evolving platform. Expect bugs and imperfections â€“ they're part of the journey! Your feedback on these is welcome and helps us prioritize. We consider bug reporting and community support to be valuable contributions under ourÂ **Reciprocity Ethos**Â ([[TERMS OF SERVICE#2. The Reciprocity Ethos: A Statement of Community Principle|ToS Section 2]]).

### **4. Licensing Our Software (Obsidian Vault Releases) - CRITICAL TO READ**  

>[!info]- **Q: How is the BETO.GROUP software (Obsidian Vault Releases) licensed? The old model seemed complex**.
>We heard that feedback! We have replaced our old licensing model with one that is incredibly simple and permissive.
>
>**All software released by BETO.GROUP is now licensed exclusively and perpetually under theÂ <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT License</a>.**

>[!info]- **Q: What does the MIT License let me do?**
>The MIT License gives you maximum freedom. You can:
> - **Use**Â the software for any purpose (personal, educational, commercial).
> - **Modify**Â the software and create your own derivative works.
> - **Distribute and Sell**Â copies of the software or your derivative works.
>It is one of the most permissive open-source licenses available. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#1. Software Licensing Model|(ToS Section 1.2)]]

>[!info]- **Q: What is my only obligation under the MIT License?**
>Your single, simple obligation isÂ **Attribution** [[LICENSE GUIDE]]. In all copies or substantial portions of the software that you distribute, youÂ **must include the original BETO.GROUP copyright notice and the full text of the MIT License**. We provide this in aÂ LICENSEÂ file with every Release to make it easy for you. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#1. Software Licensing Model|(ToS Section 1.3)]]

---

### **5. Using Our Content & Creating Your Own Works**

>[!info]- **Q: Can I use the Vault content/tools in my own commercial projects?**
>Yes, absolutely. The MIT License explicitly allows for commercial use. You can incorporate our Releases into a product you sell, as long as you fulfill the single obligation of including our copyright and license notice in your product's documentation. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#1. Software Licensing Model|(ToS Section 1.5)]]

>[!info]- **Q: If I create my own themes, plugins, or extensive notes based on your vault structure, who owns the IP?**
> You own the copyright to your original creations. The MIT license is not "viral" (like GPL), so you are not required to share your own source code. Your only legal requirement regarding our original code is to provide the copyright and license notice.

>[!info]- **Q: Can I use visual assets from the BETO.GROUP Assets Library in my projects?**
>Yes. The visual assets we create and provide within the Releases are covered by the same perpetual MIT License as the software. However, if an asset is specifically "Associated Art/Content" for one of our NFTs, then the more specific NFT license terms in [[TERMS OF SERVICE#3. Digital Collectibles (NFTs), Utility, and Associated Rights|ToS Section 3.3]] would apply to that art for the NFT holder.

>[!info]- **Q: What kind of creative freedom do I have with my derivative works, aside from licensing?**
>You have a lot of freedom to be innovative! Our main concern, outlined in ourÂ **[[TERMS OF SERVICE#7. User Conduct|User Conduct rules (ToS Section 7)]]**, is that your creations don't involve:
>
> - Illegal activities
> - Misrepresenting your work as official BETO.GROUP output
> - Harassment or harmful content
> 
>Stick to responsible and respectful creation, and you're good to go!

---

### **6. The "Reciprocity Ethos" (Our Community Principle)**

>[!info]- **Q: The old "Give Back Mechanism" is gone. What is the "Reciprocity Ethos"?**
>The Reciprocity Ethos is our community's guiding philosophy, replacing the old, legally-binding mechanism. It's a formal declaration of our belief that those who get significant value from our open-source ecosystem should voluntarily give back to it. It is a core part of our community culture. For full details, seeÂ **[[TERMS OF SERVICE#2. The Reciprocity Ethos: A Statement of Community Principle|ToS Section 2]]**.

>[!info]- **Q: Is participating in the Reciprocity Ethos legally required? Do I have to contribute if I make money?***
>**No, absolutely not.**Â This section is a statement of principle, not a legal contract. There areÂ **no revenue thresholds, no financial obligations, and no mandatory reporting**. Your access to the platform is not conditional on your participation. It is a good-faith encouragement, not a legal duty. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#2. The Reciprocity Ethos: A Statement of Community Principle|(ToS Section 2.6)]]

>[!info]- **Q: How can I contribute under the Reciprocity Ethos?**
>We value non-monetary contributions just as much, if not more, than financial ones. You can contribute by:
> - Submitting code, bug fixes, or new features.    
> - Creating and sharing high-quality tutorials or guides.
> - Helping and mentoring other users in our community channels.
> - Developing and open-sourcing your own compatible tools.
> - Making a completely voluntary donation to support the project, if you have the means and desire.
>We will strive to recognize and reward users who tangibly support this ethos. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#2. The Reciprocity Ethos: A Statement of Community Principle|(ToS Section 2.3 & 2.5)]]

### **7. BETO.GROUP NFTs (Digital Collectibles)**

>[!info]- **Q: Does BETO.GROUP offer NFTs? What are they for?**
>Yes. Their primary purpose is to function as aÂ **user account system and a method for recognizing and rewarding community contribution**. They are a way to represent your status and engagement within the BETO.GROUP ecosystem. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#3. Digital Collectibles (NFTs), Utility, and Associated Rights|(ToS Section 3.1)]]

>[!info]-Â **Q: How do I get a BETO.GROUP NFT? Can I buy one?**
>**BETO.GROUP does not offer NFTs for sale.**Â You acquire them through engagement:
> - **Base-Tier NFT:**Â All users are eligible to get a base-tier NFT for free (you only pay blockchain "gas fees") or by participating in introductory community activities. This serves as your primary account identifier.
> - **Higher-Tier NFTs:**Â These areÂ **earned, not bought**. You can achieve higher tiers by making significant non-monetary contributions to the community, such as contributing code, creating valuable content, or consistently helping other users. A voluntary donation may also be recognized with a gift of an NFT, but a non-monetary path to every tier is a core principle of our system. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#3. Digital Collectibles (NFTs), Utility, and Associated Rights|(ToS Section 3.1)]]

>[!info]- **Q: How do I get or access a BETO.GROUP NFT if I acquire one?**  
>Acquiring a BETO.GROUP NFT is designed to be straightforward!
>
>**Option 1: Use Your Existing Wallet (If you prefer)**  
If you have your own compatible blockchain wallet (e.g., MetaMask) and would like us to send your NFT directly there,Â **please provide your wallet address when prompted during the acquisition process**Â (e.g., at checkout if purchasing, or as instructed for an airdrop/event). Ensure the address is correct and on the "Applicable Blockchain Network" specified for that NFT (e.g., Avalanche, Polygon).
>
>**Option 2: Let Crossmint Handle It (Default if no wallet provided)**  
If you don't provide a specific wallet address, or if it's the standard method for a particular distribution:
>
> 1. **Email is Key:**Â We typically only need your email address.
>     
> 2. **Crossmint Handles Wallet Creation & Delivery:**Â We partner withÂ **Crossmint**Â to manage NFT minting and delivery. If you don't have a blockchain wallet already associated with your email (and didn't provide one), Crossmint will automatically create one for you to receive the NFT. You'll receive instructions from Crossmint via email on how to access this wallet and your NFT.
>     
> 3. **Retrieving Your NFT:**Â You can then manage your NFT through the Crossmint platform and, if you choose, transfer it out to another personal wallet at any time, subject to Crossmint's functionalities and any applicable blockchain network fees (gas fees).
>     
> 
> **General Information for All Methods:**
> 
> - **Delivery Time:**Â While the process is usually quick, please allow for processing time, especially for initial wallet creation (if using Crossmint) or high-demand mints. If your NFT acquisition is part of a purchase, delivery gated by the NFT may take up to seven (7) days as per our Terms of Service [[TERMS OF SERVICE#**10. Purchases and Payments for Digital Products**|(ToS Section 10.4)]].
>     
> - **Viewing Your NFT:**Â You can typically view your NFT through your wallet interface (your own, or Crossmint's), or on blockchain explorers and marketplaces that support the Applicable Blockchain Network used for that NFT.
>     
> 
> **Important Considerations:**
> 
> - **Crossmint's Terms (If applicable):**Â If a Crossmint wallet is used, your interaction with it and their services are subject to Crossmint's own terms and privacy policy, which you should review.
>     
> - **Wallet Security:**Â Whether you use your own wallet or one created by Crossmint, you are ultimately responsible for its security (e.g., private keys, seed phrases, email account security for Crossmint access). BETO.GROUP is not responsible for losses due to compromised wallets.
>     
> - **Accuracy:**Â Please ensure any email address or wallet address you provide to us is accurate and accessible to you. BETO.GROUP is not responsible for NFTs sent to incorrect addresses provided by you.
>     
> 
> (See also [[TERMS OF SERVICE#3. Digital Collectibles (NFTs), Utility, and Associated Rights|ToS Section 3.1(c)]] and [[TERMS OF SERVICE#3. Digital Collectibles (NFTs), Utility, and Associated Rights|ToS Section 3.5(e)]] regarding third-party platform reliance and user responsibilities.)

>[!info]- **Q: If I buy a BETO.GROUP NFT, what do I own?**
>You own the cryptographic token itself, recorded on the blockchain. BETO.GROUP cannot seize or modify your ownership of the token once confirmed. However, you are responsible for your wallet security. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#3. Digital Collectibles (NFTs), Utility, and Associated Rights|(ToS Section 3.1)]]

>[!info]- **Q: What rights do I get to the art associated with my BETO.GROUP NFT?**
>For any "Associated Art/Content" specifically created by BETO.GROUP for an NFT you lawfully hold, you get a broad license:
>
> - **Personal Use:**Â Use, copy, and display it for personal, non-commercial enjoyment.
> - **Broad Commercial Use:**Â An unlimited, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, display, and create derivative works for commercial use (e.g., selling merchandise with the art).
> - There are some restrictions (e.g., no hate speech). Please seeÂ **[[TERMS OF SERVICE#3. Digital Collectibles (NFTs), Utility, and Associated Rights|ToS Section 3.3]]**Â for the full license terms.

>[!info]- **Q: If my access to the BETO.GROUP Platform is terminated, what happens to my NFT and its utility?**
>Termination of your Platform access doesÂ notÂ affect your ownership of the NFT token itself on the blockchain. Your license to the Associated Art/Content generally also survives (unless the termination was for a severe breach related to the NFT itself).
>
> - **However, any "Platform-dependent Utility" of your NFT may be revoked or cease to function.**Â This means benefits requiring an active connection to BETO.GROUP's systems (like access to exclusive website areas, specific software features unlocked by the NFT, or community privileges tied to platform verification) could be lost.
> - **Full Details:**Â This is critical, seeÂ [[TERMS OF SERVICE#8. Termination|**ToS Section 8.2(c)]]**Â for a detailed explanation and examples of Platform-dependent Utility.

>[!info]- **Q: Are BETO.GROUP NFTs a financial investment?**
>**NO, AND THIS IS CRITICAL.**Â They are explicitlyÂ **NOT**Â offered as financial investments. They are a tool for community recognition and utility. We make no guarantees about their future financial value. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#3. Digital Collectibles (NFTs), Utility, and Associated Rights|(ToS Section 3.5)]]

### **8. Feedback & Community**

>[!info]- **Q: How can I give feedback?**
>We highly encourage feedback! You can submit it via email toÂ contact@beto.groupÂ or through our official community channels (like Discord), as guided by those platforms. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#6. Feedback|(ToS Section 6.1)]]

>[!info]- **Q: If I give feedback, what rights does BETO.GROUP have to my ideas?**
>When you submit Feedback, you grant BETO.GROUP a very broad, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, modify, and exploit that Feedback for any purpose, including commercially, without compensation to you. However, if your Feedback contains original ideas for which you hold pre-existing intellectual property rights (like a patentable invention that exists independently of the feedback submitted), you retain ownership of that underlying IP. Our license is to theÂ Feedback as submitted. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#6. Feedback|(ToS Sections 6.2, 6.3)]]

>[!info]- **Q: Are there rewards for feedback or contributions?**
> Yes! We may offer rewards, recognition, or compensation for exceptionally valuable feedback or significant "big-picture ideas." This is at our sole discretion and may be subject to a separate written agreement. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#6. Feedback|(ToS Section 6.5)]]

>[!info]- **Q: What if my feedback is on an older version of the Vault?**
>While all feedback is appreciated, feedback on the latest Vault Release is most helpful. Feedback on older versions might not be prioritized unless it highlights an exceptional issue or idea relevant to current development.

>[!info]- **Q: I'm part of a "datacore community" or pre-release testing group. Are there different rules for me?**
>Yes, possibly. For specific pre-release, beta, or community feedback versions of the vault, we might have special conditions (e.g., confidentiality, specific feedback requirements, restrictions on use before public release). These conditions will be clearly communicated to you when you receive such a version or join such a group. For publicly available Releases, the standard licensing terms apply.

### **9. Purchases and Payments**

>[!info]- **Q: Does BETO.GROUP sell digital products, like specific Vault Releases?**
>Yes, we may offer certain digital products for purchase, including specific Releases of our Obsidian vaults. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#**10. Purchases and Payments for Digital Products**|(ToS Section 10)]]

>[!info]- **Q: What is your refund policy for purchased digital products?**
>**ALL SALES OF PURCHASED DIGITAL PRODUCTS ARE FINAL.**Â Due to their digital nature and immediate access/download, we offerÂ **NO REFUNDS, RETURNS, OR EXCHANGES**, except as expressly required by mandatory applicable law that cannot be waived. By purchasing, you acknowledge you are waiving refund rights once delivery/access has commenced (subject to applicable law). Please review product descriptions carefully before buying. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#**10. Purchases and Payments for Digital Products**|(ToS Section 10.5)]]

>[!info]- **Q: How are purchased digital products licensed?**
>They are licensed according to our standard software licensing model detailed in Section 4 of this FAQ and Section 1 of our ToS (i.e., MIT for 6 months from availability, then GPLv3, or your elective GPLv3 from start). Purchasing grants you a license to use the product, not ownership of the IP. **[[TERMS OF SERVICE#10. Purchases and Payments for Digital Products|(ToS Section 10.6)]]**

>[!info]- **Q: How quickly are purchased digital products delivered?**
>Typically, access or download is available immediately or shortly after payment confirmation. However, if an NFT (e.g., via Crossmint) gates access to the purchased product, NFT processing and delivery might take up to seven (7) days. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#**10. Purchases and Payments for Digital Products**|(ToS Section 10.4)]]

---

### **10. Account & Platform Access**Â 

>[!info]- **Q: Do I need an account to use BETO.GROUP?**
>Accessing the website or downloading generally available Releases may not require an account. However, for certain features, purchases, NFT utility verification, or community participation, an account (e.g., providing an email address) might be necessary.

>[!info]- **Q: Under what circumstances can BETO.GROUP terminate my access to the Platform?**
>We can suspend or terminate your access for aÂ **material breach**Â of our Terms of Service. This includes things like illegal activities, security violations, IP infringement (e.g., distributing our software without the required license notice), severe harassment, or other actions that harm the platform or community. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#8. Termination|(ToS Section 8.1)]]

>[!info]- **Q: If my platform access is terminated, what happens to software I've already downloaded or NFTs I own?**
>
> -**Software:**Â Your right to use previously downloaded software Releases remains subject to the specific license terms (MIT or GPLv3) applicable to those versions when you obtained them or as they transitioned. 
> - **NFTs:**Â Termination doesn't affect your ownership of the NFT token itself on the blockchain. Associated Art/Content licenses generally survive. However,Â **Platform-dependent Utility**Â (benefits requiring an active connection to our systems)Â **may be revoked or cease to function.**
> - **Full Details:**Â This is important. SeeÂ **[[TERMS OF SERVICE#8. Termination|ToS Section 8.2]]**Â for a complete explanation.

>[!info]- **Q: Can I appeal a termination decision?**
>Yes. If your access is terminated, you can appeal within thirty (30) days by emailingÂ legalis@beto.groupÂ with your reasons and any supporting evidence. We will review appeals in good faith. The decision following an appeal review is at our discretion. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#8. Termination|(ToS Section 8.4)]]

>[!info]- **Q: What happens if I violate User Conduct rules (ToS Section 7)?**
>Violations can lead to warnings, suspension, or termination of your platform access, removal of content, and potentially legal action depending on the severity. Prohibited activities include illegal acts, security violations, IP infringement, harassment, spam, NFT misconduct, impersonation, etc. Please review [[TERMS OF SERVICE#7. User Conduct|ToS Section 7]] carefully.

>[!info]-Â **Q: What happens if BETO.GROUP itself shuts down or discontinues the platform?**  
>If we were to permanently discontinue the platform, anyÂ **platform-dependent utility**Â for your NFTs would cease to function. However, in line with our open-source ethos, we would endeavor to provide a final, complete open-source release of all core software and assets, along with documentation, to empower the community to continue the project independently if they choose. This is a good-faith commitment, not a legally binding guarantee. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#8. Termination|(ToS Section 8.5)]]

### **11. Legal, Privacy & Policies**

>[!info]- **Q: Where can I find your Terms of Service and Privacy Policy?**
>Â You can find links to our fullÂ **[[TERMS OF SERVICE]]**Â andÂ **[[PRIVACY POLICIES]]**Â at the bottom of our main website pages and often linked from within our Releases (e.g., in theÂ [[FAQ.enigma]]Â orÂ [[LICENSE GUIDE]]).

>[!info]- **Q: Do I have to agree to the Terms of Service?**

>We reserve the right to modify the Terms. For material changes, we'll provide at least 30 days' prior notice, primarily via email to your last provided address and/or a prominent notice on our Platform. Your continued use after changes take effect means you accept the new Terms. It's your responsibility to keep your email current and review the Terms periodically. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#11. Modification of Terms|(ToS Section 11)]]

>[!info]- **Q: What is BETO.GROUP's liability if something goes wrong?**
