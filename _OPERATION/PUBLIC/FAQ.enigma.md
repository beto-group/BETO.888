### **1. The Heart of BETO.GROUP: Our Essence & Edicts**

>[!info]- **Q: What is the nature of BETO.GROUP? What dream does it pursue?**
>Imagine an ever-unfurling scroll, a digital ecosystem where ideas clash, meld, and birth new stars. This is BETO.GROUP â€“ a crucible for learning, a forge for your creative spirit, primarily manifesting through our Obsidian Sanctuaries (Vaults) and their attendant instruments. We navigate by the principle of "Nullius in verba," seeking truth in manifested works rather than mere pronouncements. Here, ancient echoes find resonance with modern ingenuity, a perennial "war of ideas" that fuels discovery.

>[!info]- **Q: This "War of Ideas" you speak of... what is its essence?**
>It is the sacred dance of inquiry, the relentless questioning and re-shaping of what is known and what is imagined. It's the beautiful friction of the mind, the intellectual current that, through challenge and curiosity, polishes raw thought into gleaming insight. Our realm is crafted to be a vessel for this sacred contest.

>[!info]- **Q: Who tends the fires of BETO.GROUP? What entity guides its voyage?**
>At present, the currents of BETO.GROUP are channeled primarily through a singular vessel â€“ a devoted artisan. Thus, it is a tapestry woven with passion, perpetually in flux. Your insights, your understanding, are the winds that fill our sails as we navigate these uncharted waters.

>[!info]- **Q: Does the 'Artificial Mind' whisper within BETO.GROUP's walls?**
>We jest that it is "AI-ish hehe ðŸ«¡." While the tools of the modern age lend their strength, the spirit, the vision, the intricate design â€“ these flow from a human heart and mind. The Artificial Mind may lend a hand in the forge, but the grand design remains ours, deeply personal and intentionally crafted.

---
### **2. Our Lexicon: The Cartography of Ideas**

>[!info]- **Q: Your scrolls speak in a curious tongue â€“ ENIGMAS, ZU, NAMZU... Unveil their meanings.**
>These are the stars by which we navigate our inner cosmos, the very framework of our "war of ideas." Each term is a key to a different chamber within our shared exploration:
>
> - [[ENIGMAS]]: The primordial chaos of creation; the raw, untamed thoughts from which all innovation springs.
> - [[NAMZU]]: The silent, unifying soul-fire that lends identity and cohesion to every facet of our domain.
> - [[ETHR]]: The ever-flowing river of knowledge, a dynamic framework where understanding and discovery intertwine.
> - [[SUD]]: The subtle threads of connection, weaving unexpected patterns and synergies between disparate sparks of thought.
> - [[PARAGOGI]]: The living chronicle of our creative endeavors, a gallery of experiments forever in motion.
> - [[NARU]]: Our visual memory, the steles upon which images and resonant echoes are etched, adding depth to our lore.
> - [[ZU]]: The wellspring of learning, where we gather the seeds of curiosity for cultivation and deeper understanding.
> - [[UN]]: The bridge to the outer worlds, connecting our inner explorations with the vast, echoing chambers of the digital collective.
>
>For a deeper immersion into this language, seek the scroll titled [[WHAT DO WE DO Â¿ = A-NA I-AK E-NE ?]].

>[!info]- **Q: Why this particular constellation of terms? What purpose does this sacred vocabulary serve?**
>This lexicon is the architecture of our "war of ideas," a unique lens through which discovery and creation are focused. Each term is an invitation, a portal to explore not only the layers of our ecosystem but, perhaps, the uncharted territories of your own creative spirit.

### **3. The Obsidian Sanctum: Our Vault & Its Echoes**

>[!info]- **Q: What is this "BETO.888 Obsidian Vault" of which you speak?**
>The BETO.GROUP Obsidian Vault (often bearing the mark "BETO.888" as a sigil of its series) is the primary vessel of our offerings. It is an ever-evolving sanctuary of instruments, our unique "enigmas" (voyages into diverse realms of thought), datacore shards for the Obsidian arts, a treasury of visual assets, and within its heart, the guiding scrolls of our [[LICENSE GUIDE]] and this very [[FAQ.enigma]]. All are crafted to empower your journey through Obsidian and illuminate your personal path of discovery.

>[!info]- **Q: What treasures does a Vault Release bestow upon the seeker?**
>Each descent into a newly unveiled Vault Release typically reveals:
> - A constellation of "enigmas" to ignite your exploration.
> - A set of "datacore shards" to refine your mastery of Obsidian.
> - A treasury of visual assets to adorn your own creations.
> - The embedded wisdom of our [[LICENSE GUIDE]] and [[FAQ.enigma]] scrolls.
> - The [[CHANGE LOG]] chronicle, marking its date of awakening and the transformations within.
>
>[A Whisper of Potential] We may, as the currents dictate, extend future boons or privileged passage to other offerings for those who embrace our Releases, though such grace is offered at our sole discretion.

>[!info]- **Q: How often does the Obsidian Sanctum unveil new forms?**
>Our intention is to reveal a new iteration of the Obsidian Sanctum with each passing moon. Every new unveiling is a distinct "Release" under the covenants of our Terms of Service, bearing its own "Date of Awakening" â€“ a detail of great import for the dance of licenses (as detailed in the fourth VITAL SCROLL below).

>[!info]- **Q: How might one navigate the labyrinthine paths within the Vault?**
>We advise beginning your pilgrimage at the Beacon Section (often found as Bookmarks upon the leftward scroll in Obsidian) to discern the major constellations of knowledge. You may also chart your course using our internal "888" ley-lines (whose secrets are revealed within the Vault) and immerse yourself in our "METHODOLOGY" to grasp the deeper architecture.

>[!info]- **Q: Is the Vault a perfected artifact, or does it still breathe with the flux of creation? Should one anticipate the whispers of imperfection (bugs)?**
>Aye, with utmost certainty! BETO.GROUP is a living experiment, a sanctuary ever in the process of becoming. Anticipate the charming imperfections, the "bugs" that are but echoes of its vibrant evolution â€“ they are intrinsic to this shared odyssey! Your observations on these are precious pearls that help us chart our course. Such offerings of insight, especially regarding these imperfections or realms ripe for enhancement, may even find themselves honored with tokens of recognition. Consult the ancient wisdom on feedback inscribed within our [[TERMS OF SERVICE#6. Feedback|Terms of Service, Section 6]].

### **4. The Dance of Licenses: Navigating Our Software's Flow - A VITAL SCROLL**

>[!info]- **Q: Â The Obsidian Sanctuaries (Vault Releases)... by what covenant are they shared? The old dance of licenses felt like a shifting labyrinth.**
>We have heard these whispers and have since illuminated the path. The old, shifting labyrinth has been replaced by a single, unwavering beacon.
>**All Sanctuaries and software forged by BETO.GROUP are now, and forevermore, shared under the singular, perpetual grace of theÂ <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT Covenant</a>.**
>The dance of transitioning licenses is no more. The twin paths have merged into one. The six-moon cycles have ceased. There is only the MIT Covenant, simple and enduring. For the full inscription, seeÂ **[[TERMS OF SERVICE#1. Software Licensing Model|Section 1 of our Sacred Pacts (Terms of Service)]]**.

>[!info]- **Q: What freedoms does this singular MIT Covenant bestow?**
>It grants you profound liberty. You are free to:
> - **Employ**Â the Sanctuary for any endeavor, be it for personal enlightenment, scholarly pursuit, or worldly commerce.
> - **Reshape**Â its very essence, weaving your own spirit into its form to create new derivative works.
> - **Share and Offer**Â copies of the Sanctuary, or your newly woven tapestries, in any forum or marketplace.
>It is a covenant of immense trust and creative empowerment. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#1. Software Licensing Model|(ToS Section 1.2)]]

>[!info]- **Q: What is the sole, sacred vow I must keep under this MIT Covenant?**
>Your single, solemn obligation is that ofÂ **Attribution**. In any copy of the Sanctuary or in any substantial part of it that you share with others, youÂ **must preserve the original mark of BETO.GROUP's creation (the copyright notice) and the full text of the MIT Covenant itself**. We have placed this vow within aÂ LICENSEÂ scroll in every Sanctuary to make its fulfillment a simple matter. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#1. Software Licensing Model|(ToS Section 1.3)]]

---
### **5. Weaving Your Own Tapestry: Creation & Contribution**

>[!info]- **Q: May I weave the threads of the Vault's wisdom and instruments into my own commercial endeavors?**
>Aye, with our full blessing. The MIT Covenant expressly welcomes such endeavors. You may weave our Sanctuaries into a creation you offer for worldly exchange, so long as you honor the sacred vow of including our creator's mark and the license covenant in your creation's accompanying scrolls. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#1. Software Licensing Model|(ToS Section 1.5)]]

>[!info]- **Q: If I craft my own sacred patterns (themes), potent enchantments (plugins), or extensive scrolls of wisdom, drawing inspiration from your Vault's architecture, who holds dominion over these new creations?**
>The authorship of your original weavings is yours alone. The MIT Covenant does not demand a tribute of your own secrets; you are not required to share the hidden patterns (source code) of your unique creations. Your only sacred duty concerning our original threads is to honor them with attribution.

>[!info]- **Q: May I employ the visual sigils from the BETO.GROUP Treasury of Assets within my own works?**
>The visual sigils we forge and offer within our Sanctuaries are generally imbued with the same shifting spirit as the Sanctuary Release itself (MIT for six moons, then GPLv3, or your elective GPLv3 path). Yet, if a sigil is a unique "Associated Art/Content" tied to one of our Digital Relics (NFTs), then the covenant of that Relic, found in [[TERMS OF SERVICE#3. Digital Collectibles (NFTs), Utility, and Associated Rights|ToS Section 3.3]] (which grants generous passage for commercial use), would govern that specific sigil for the Relic's keeper.
>
> - We endeavor to craft original sigils or draw from those offered under generous covenants. However, seek the wisdom in **[[TERMS OF SERVICE#5. Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability; Indemnification|ToS Section 5.6]]** concerning our disavowal of unintended infringement and the path to follow should you believe a sigil encroaches upon another's sacred marks. The onus is upon you to ensure your use of any sigil is in harmony with all laws and covenants.

>[!info]- **Q: Beyond these Covenants of License, are there other edicts that shape what I may say or do with the tapestries I weave from BETO.GROUP materials?**
>You possess great liberty to innovate and give form to your visions! Our primary concern, inscribed within our **[[TERMS OF SERVICE#7. User Conduct|Edicts of Conduct (ToS Section 7)]]**, is that your creations do not become vessels for:
>
> - Illicit acts or forbidden sorcery.
> - Deception, such as claiming your work is an untouched, official artifact of BETO.GROUP.
> - Words of malice, harassment, or the weaving of harmful illusions.
>
>Weave with responsibility and reverence for the community, and your creative spirit may soar.

### **6. The Ethos of Reciprocity: Our Community's Guiding Star**

>[!info]- **Q: The old "Give Back Covenant" with its binding tithes seems to have vanished. What is this "Reciprocity Ethos" that now guides you?**
>The old covenant of binding tribute has dissolved, giving way to a new guiding star: TheÂ **Reciprocity Ethos**. This is not a law, but a principle of the heart. It is our deeply held belief, our shared philosophy, that those who draw great sustenance from the open wellspring of our ecosystem should, in turn, offer a voluntary libation back to nourish it. It is the very soul of our community culture. The full philosophy is chronicled inÂ **[[TERMS OF SERVICE#2. The Reciprocity Ethos: A Statement of Community Principle|ToS Section 2]]**.

>[!info]- **Q: Is this Ethos a binding vow? Am I legally bound to contribute if my endeavors flourish?**
>**Nay, not at all.**Â This is a matter of spirit, not of binding law. There areÂ **no thresholds of revenue, no mandatory tithes, no rites of reporting**. Your passage through our realms is in no way conditional upon your offerings. It is a heartfelt encouragement, a call to join a cycle of mutual support, not a legal decree. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#2. The Reciprocity Ethos: A Statement of Community Principle|(ToS Section 2.6)]]

>[!info]- **Q: How might one honor this Reciprocity Ethos?**
>We hold offerings of wisdom and effort in as high regard as gifts of coin, if not higher. You may honor the ethos by:
> - Offering threads of new code, mending imperfections (bug fixes), or revealing new features.
> - Weaving and sharing scrolls of great wisdom or tutorials for others to follow.
> - Mentoring fellow voyagers and tending the hearth-fire in our community conclaves.
> - Forging and sharing your own compatible instruments under an open covenant.
> - Offering a purely voluntary gift of coin to sustain the forge, should your heart and means align.
>
>We shall endeavor to honor and recognize those whose actions shine brightly with the spirit of this ethos. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#2. The Reciprocity Ethos: A Statement of Community Principle|(ToS Section 2.3 & 2.5)]]

### **7. Digital Relics: Understanding BETO.GROUP NFTs**

>[!info]- **Q: Does BETO.GROUP craft Digital Relics (NFTs)? What purpose do these sigils serve?**
>Indeed. Their foremost purpose has been clarified: they serve asÂ **sigils of community standing**, asÂ **keys to your identity**Â within our fellowship, and as a means for us toÂ **recognize and honor contribution**. They are artifacts of engagement, not instruments of commerce. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#3. Digital Collectibles (NFTs), Utility, and Associated Rights|(ToS Section 3.1)]]

>[!info]-Â **Q: How does a seeker acquire a BETO.GROUP Relic? Can it be purchased with worldly coin?**
>**BETO.GROUP does not offer these Relics for worldly exchange.**Â They are bestowed, not sold. One acquires them through participation in the lifeblood of the community:
> - **The Initiate's Sigil (Base-Tier):**Â All voyagers may claim a base-tier Relic for free passage (save for the etheric tithes of the blockchain itself) or by partaking in introductory rites within our community. This Relic is your mark of identity.
> - **The Adept's Sigil (Higher-Tiers):**Â These honored Relics areÂ **earned through meaningful contribution**. They are gifted to those who offer significant non-monetary tributes: weaving code, crafting vital lore for others, or consistently tending to the fellowship. While a voluntary gift of coin may be met with our gratitude in the form of a Relic, a path to every tier through selfless action shall always be maintained as a sacred principle. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#3. Digital Collectibles (NFTs), Utility, and Associated Rights|(ToS Section 3.1)]]

>[!info]- **Q: If I am entrusted with a BETO.GROUP Relic (NFT), how does its spirit reach me? May I use my own sacred coffer (wallet)?**
>Receiving a BETO.GROUP Relic is intended as a seamless passage, with pathways for your choosing!
>
>**Path of the Adept: Your Own Coffer (If you so choose)**
>Should you possess a compatible sacred coffer (blockchain wallet, e.g., MetaMask) and desire your Relic to reside therein directly, **you must present your coffer's sigil (wallet address) when the way is shown** (at the moment of exchange, if purchasing, or as the oracle dictates for a sacred drop or community gifting). Ensure the sigil is true and resonates with the "Applicable Blockchain Network" (e.g., Avalanche, Polygon) upon which the Relic is to be inscribed.
>
>**Path of the Initiate: Let the Crossmint Scribe Attend (Default if no coffer declared)**
>If no specific coffer's sigil is presented by you, or if it is the appointed method for a particular bestowal:
>
>1.  **Your Email, The Key:** We typically require only your email inscription for this path.
>2.  **The Crossmint Scribe Forges & Delivers:** We are allied with the **Crossmint** scribes for the crafting and bestowal of Relics. If your email is not yet bound to a blockchain coffer (and you have not declared one), Crossmint will dutifully forge one for your Relic's arrival. Missives from Crossmint, sent to your email, will guide you to this newly crafted coffer and your enshrined Relic.
>3.  **Claiming Your Relic's Power:** You may then commune with your Relic via the Crossmint sanctum and, should your will incline, transfer its essence to another personal coffer at any time, subject to Crossmint's own edicts and the network's rightful tithes (gas fees).
>
>**General Edicts for All Paths of Reception:**
>
>   - **The Flow of Time (Delivery):** Though the currents usually flow swiftly, allow for the passage of time for the ritual of bestowal, especially if a new coffer is being forged by Crossmint or if the etheric winds of demand are strong. If your Relic is tied to an exchange of offering (a purchase), its arrival to unlock further passage may take up to seven suns, as written in our Pacts ([[TERMS OF SERVICE#**10. Purchases and Payments for Digital Products**|ToS Section 10.4]]).
>   - **Gazing Upon Your Relic (Viewing):** Your Relic's form may typically be perceived through the interface of your chosen coffer (be it your own or that crafted by Crossmint), or upon the public scrolls of blockchain explorers and marketplaces that honor the Applicable Blockchain Network upon which your Relic is inscribed.
>
>**Solemn Admonitions:**
>
>-   **The Crossmint Covenant (If Applicable):** Should a Crossmint coffer be employed, your communion with it and the services of the scribes are subject to Crossmint's own sacred pacts and privacy edicts, which you are urged to consult.
>-   **Guardianship of the Coffer:** Whether you employ your own ancient coffer or one newly forged by Crossmint, its sanctity and protection (the secret keys, the seed words, the security of your email portal for Crossmint access) are your sacred duty. BETO.GROUP bears no burden for Relics lost to compromised coffers.
>-   **Truth in Inscription (Accuracy):** Ensure that any email inscription or coffer's sigil you provide to us is true and accessible to you. BETO.GROUP is not accountable for Relics sent astray due to errant inscriptions on your part.
>
>(Further wisdom on these matters can be found in [[TERMS OF SERVICE#3. Digital Collectibles (NFTs), Utility, and Associated Rights|ToS Section 3.1(c)]] and [[TERMS OF SERVICE#3. Digital Collectibles (NFTs), Utility, and Associated Rights|ToS Section 3.5(e)]] regarding reliance on external scribes and your duties as a keeper.)

>[!info]- **Q: If I become a keeper of a BETO.GROUP Relic (NFT), what is the true nature of my wardship?**
>You become the recognized keeper of the cryptographic sigil itself, its existence affirmed upon the great immutable ledger of the blockchain. BETO.GROUP cannot reclaim or alter your wardship of this sigil once the rites of transfer are complete and confirmed. However, the safeguarding of your own coffer (wallet) is a burden you must bear. (This is enshrined in [[TERMS OF SERVICE#3. Digital Collectibles (NFTs), Utility, and Associated Rights|ToS Section 3.1]]).

>[!info]- **Q: What rights are bestowed upon me concerning the sacred art bound to my BETO.GROUP Relic (NFT)?**
>For any "Associated Art/Content" â€“ those unique visions specifically crafted by BETO.GROUP and mystically linked to a Relic you lawfully keep â€“ a generous covenant is granted:
>
> - **For Personal Contemplation:** The right to use, replicate, and display its beauty for your own private, non-commercial reverence.
> - **For Broader Manifestation (Commercial Use):** An unbounded, worldwide, royalty-free passage to use, replicate, display, and even weave new derivative forms for the marketplaces of the world (e.g., crafting and selling wares adorned with the sacred art).
> - Yet, even this freedom has its sacred boundaries (e.g., the art may not serve as a vessel for hatred or discord). We bid you study the full terms of this artistic covenant in **[[TERMS OF SERVICE#3. Digital Collectibles (NFTs), Utility, and Associated Rights|ToS Section 3.3]]**.

>[!info]- **Q: Should my passage through the BETO.GROUP Platform be barred, what becomes of my Relic (NFT) and the powers it grants?**
>The ending of your passage through our Platform does *not* sever your wardship of the Relic's sigil itself upon the blockchain. The covenant granting rights to its Associated Art/Content also generally endures (unless the barring was due to a grave sacrilege involving the Relic itself).
>
> - **However, take heed: any "Platform-dependent Utility" of your Relic may be suspended or fade from existence.** This means those boons that require an active resonance with BETO.GROUP's own inner sanctums (such as entry to guarded chambers on our website, special abilities within our software unlocked by the Relic, or marks of honor within our fellowship verified by Platform instruments) could be lost to you.
> - **The Full Oracle:** This is a matter of great import. Consult **[[TERMS OF SERVICE#8. Termination|ToS Section 8.2(c)]]** for a detailed divination and examples of this Platform-dependent Utility.

>[!info]- **Q: Are these BETO.GROUP Relics to be considered tokens of worldly fortune?**
>**Nay, and heed this well.**Â They are explicitlyÂ **not**Â offered as instruments of financial speculation. They are artifacts of community, keys to utility, and symbols of your journey with us. We offer no prophecies of their future market value. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#3. Digital Collectibles (NFTs), Utility, and Associated Rights|(ToS Section 3.5)]]

---
### **8. The Confluence: Feedback & The Collective Mind**

>[!info]- **Q: How might I offer my insights or observations (feedback) to BETO.GROUP?**
>Your whispers of insight are most welcome at our hearth! You may send them via ethereal missive (email) to `contact@beto.group` or share them within our designated community conclaves (such as Discord), as guided by the customs of those spaces. (Our Pacts speak of this in [[TERMS OF SERVICE#6. Feedback|ToS Section 6.1]]).

>[!info]- **Q: If I share my thoughts and ideas as Feedback, what becomes of their essence? Does BETO.GROUP claim dominion over them?**
>When you offer Feedback, you grant BETO.GROUP a vast and enduring passage â€“ a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free right to draw upon, transform, and employ that Feedback for any purpose, even for commerce, without earthly tribute to you. However, should your Feedback carry within it original seeds of invention to which you hold prior sacred claim (such as a patentable artifice that exists independently of the Feedback offered), you retain wardship of that underlying intellectual spirit. Our right extends to the *Feedback as it is offered to us*. (This distinction is clarified in [[TERMS OF SERVICE#6. Feedback|ToS Sections 6.2 and 6.3]]).

>[!info]- **Q: Are there boons or recognition for particularly profound feedback or contributions to the collective vision?**
>Indeed! We may choose to honor exceptionally insightful feedback or grand "visions of the whole" with tokens of gratitude, recognition, or other forms of recompense. Such honors are bestowed at our sole discretion and may be formalized by a separate covenant. (This possibility is noted in [[TERMS OF SERVICE#6. Feedback|ToS Section 6.5]]).

>[!info]- **Q: What if my feedback pertains to an older echo of the Vault, a version no longer current?**
>While all shared wisdom is held in regard, insights concerning the most recent unveiling of the Vault are most potent for our current weaving. Feedback on past echoes might not be as readily integrated unless it illuminates an extraordinary matter or a timeless principle relevant to our present path.

>[!info]- **Q: I am part of a "datacore fellowship" or a circle of pre-release augurs. Do different edicts apply to my offerings?**
>Yes, it is possible. For certain guarded pre-release, beta, or community feedback iterations of the Vault, we might establish unique conditions (e.g., vows of silence, specific rites of feedback, limitations on use before public unveiling). These special edicts will be made known to you upon your entry into such a fellowship or receipt of such a guarded version. For the publicly unveiled Releases, the standard covenants of licensing prevail.

---
### **9. The Exchange: Offerings & Their Currents**

>[!info]- **Q: Does BETO.GROUP offer certain digital artifacts, such as specific Vault Sanctuaries, through an exchange of offerings (purchase)?**
>Aye, we may present certain digital creations for exchange, including specific iterations of our Obsidian Sanctuaries. (This is covered in [[TERMS OF SERVICE#**10. Purchases and Payments for Digital Products**|ToS Section 10]]).

>[!info]- **Q: What is the decree regarding the return of offerings (refunds) for such digital artifacts once exchanged?**
>Hear this decree clearly: **ALL EXCHANGES FOR PURCHASED DIGITAL ARTIFACTS ARE FINAL.** Given their ethereal nature and the immediate passage or download granted upon exchange, we offer **NO RETURN OF OFFERINGS, NO REVERSALS, NOR EXCHANGES**, save where mandated by immutable law that cannot be set aside. By completing an exchange, you acknowledge the foregoing of any right to retract your offering once passage to the artifact has commenced (subject to the aforementioned immutable law). We counsel you to peruse the descriptions of artifacts with care before an exchange is made. (This is firmly stated in [[TERMS OF SERVICE#**10. Purchases and Payments for Digital Products**|ToS Section 10.5]]).

>[!info]- **Q: By what covenant are such purchased digital artifacts governed?**
>They are governed by the same sacred dance of licenses detailed in the fourth VITAL SCROLL of this FAQ and in Section 1 of our Pacts (Terms of Service) â€“ that is, MIT's grace for six moons from their awakening, then the embrace of GPLv3, or your own elective anointing with GPLv3 from inception. An exchange grants you a covenant to use the artifact, not dominion over its inherent intellectual spirit. (As per **[[TERMS OF SERVICE#10. Purchases and Payments for Digital Products|(ToS Section 10.6)]]**).

>[!info]- **Q: How swiftly are these purchased digital artifacts delivered unto the seeker?**
>Typically, passage to or download of the artifact is granted immediately or shortly after the offering is confirmed. However, should a Digital Relic (NFT, perhaps via the Crossmint Scribes) guard entry to the purchased artifact, the ritual of NFT bestowal and delivery might require up to seven suns to complete. (This is noted in [[TERMS OF SERVICE#**10. Purchases and Payments for Digital Products**|ToS Section 10.4]]).

---
### **10. The Portal: Access, Pathways & Their Guardians**

>[!info]- **Q: Is an account, a mark of identity, required to traverse the realms of BETO.GROUP?**
>Passage through the public courtyards of our website or the acquisition of generally available Sanctuary Releases may not require such a mark. Yet, for entry into certain guarded chambers, for exchanges of offerings, for the affirmation of a Digital Relic's utility, or for full participation in our community conclaves, a mark of passage (such as the inscription of an email address) might be necessary.

>[!info]- **Q: Under what omens might BETO.GROUP bar my passage to the Platform?**
>We may suspend or sever your passage for any grave breach of our Sacred Pacts (Terms of Service). Such omens include, but are not limited to, violating the Edicts of Conduct (e.g., forbidden sorcery, infringement upon sacred marks, acts of malice), transgressing the covenants of software licensing, misusing Digital Relics, or failing to honor the Cycle of Reciprocity after due affirmation. (This is written in [[TERMS OF SERVICE#8. Termination|ToS Section 8.1]]).

>[!info]- **Q: If my passage through the Platform is barred, what becomes of the Sanctuaries I have already downloaded or the Digital Relics I keep?**
>
> -**Sanctuaries (Software):** Your covenant to use previously downloaded Sanctuary Releases remains bound by the specific license terms (MIT or GPLv3) applicable to those versions at the time of their acquisition or as their spirit transitioned.
> - **Digital Relics (NFTs):** The barring does not strip you of your wardship of the Relic's sigil itself upon the blockchain. The covenant granting rights to its Associated Art/Content also generally endures. However, mark this well: **Platform-dependent Utility** (those boons requiring an active resonance with our inner sanctums) **may be revoked or fade from your perception.**
> - **The Full Divination:** This is of consequence. Seek the complete wisdom in **[[TERMS OF SERVICE#8. Termination|ToS Section 8.2]]**.

>[!info]- **Q: May I seek an appeal if such a barring decision is decreed?**
>Yes. Should your passage be barred, you may appeal this decree within thirty suns by sending a missive to `legalis@beto.group`, detailing your reasons and any testaments you wish to offer. We shall review such appeals with a just heart. The final word following such review remains at our discretion. (This path is shown in [[TERMS OF SERVICE#8. Termination|ToS Section 8.4]]).

>[!info]- **Q: What unfolds if I transgress the Edicts of Conduct (ToS Section 7)?**
>Transgressions may lead to admonitions, suspension of passage, the barring of access, removal of woven content, and potentially invocation of external covenants (legal action), depending on the gravity of the act. Forbidden acts include illicit sorcery, violations of sanctity, infringement upon sacred marks, acts of malice, the spreading of plagues (spam), misuse of Digital Relics, false impersonations, and more. We urge you to study [[TERMS OF SERVICE#7. User Conduct|ToS Section 7]] with diligence.

>[!info]-Â **Q: What becomes of the realm and its Relics if BETO.GROUP itself should cease its voyage and the fires of the forge grow cold?**
>Should our own grand voyage conclude and the Platform be set to slumber eternally, anyÂ **Platform-dependent Utility**Â of your Relicsâ€”those powers that require a living connection to our inner sanctumsâ€”would indeed fade into memory. However, in a final act of honoring our Reciprocity Ethos, we would endeavor to offer a final, complete Sanctuary Release, with all core software and assets unbound by the MIT Covenant, along with our last guiding scrolls. This final offering would be to empower the fellowship, should they so choose, to carry the embers of this project forward on their own. This is our solemn, good-faith intention, not a legally binding prophecy. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#8. Termination|(ToS Section 8.5)]]

### **11. The Pacts & Protections: Our Sacred Texts (Legal)**

>[!info]- **Q: Where lie the master scrolls of your Terms of Service and Privacy Policy?**
>You shall find portals to our complete **[[TERMS OF SERVICE]]** and **[[PRIVACY POLICIES]]** upon the foundation stones of our main website and often linked from within the heart of our Sanctuaries (e.g., within this [[FAQ.enigma]] or the [[LICENSE GUIDE]]). We implore you to read them with focused intent, for they are the covenants that govern your voyage within the BETO.GROUP expanse.

>[!info]- **Q: Is it my sacred duty to agree to these Terms of Service?**
>Indeed. Your passage into and use of the BETO.GROUP Website and our wider Platform (including any downloaded Obsidian Sanctuary) are granted only upon your sworn accord with our Terms of Service. For passage into the core functionalities of a downloaded Sanctuary or other specific sacred spaces, you will be called upon to affirm your agreement (e.g., by marking a sigil upon a checkbox) before first entry or use. (This is ordained in [[TERMS OF SERVICE#13. Agreement to Terms|ToS Section 13]]).

>[!info]- **Q: What is BETO.GROUP's vow concerning privacy and the guardianship of personal chronicles?**
>We are bound by a vow to protect your privacy. OurÂ **Privacy Policy**Â chronicles what echoes of your presence we gather, how we employ them, and your rights regarding these chronicles. These rights include the seeking, amending, or requesting erasure of your data, and under certain omens, theÂ **portability of your chronicles**Â to carry with you. Make your requests via missive toÂ legalis@beto.group. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#4. Privacy Policy Summary and Third-Party Services|(ToS Section 4.1)]]

>[!info]- **Q: By what ancient law are these Terms of Service governed? And should discord arise, where is judgment sought?**
>Our Terms of Service are governed by the ancient laws of the Province of Alberta and the overarching federal laws of Canada. Should discord lead to formal judgment, such matters will generally find their forum exclusively within the courts situated in the city of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, Canada. Voyagers from distant lands acknowledge this sacred ground and the potential journeys it may entail. (This is decreed in [[TERMS OF SERVICE#12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction|ToS Section 12]]).

>[!info]- **Q: How shall I know if these Sacred Pacts (Terms of Service) are altered by the turning of ages?**
>We reserve the right to reshape these Pacts. For transformations of material significance, we shall sound a call at least 30 suns prior, primarily by ethereal missive to your last inscribed address and/or by a prominent sigil upon our Platform. Your continued voyage after such transformations take hold signifies your acceptance of the new Pacts. It is your sacred duty to keep your inscribed email current and to periodically consult the Pacts for their evolving wisdom. (As per [[TERMS OF SERVICE#11. Modification of Terms|ToS Section 11]]).

>[!info]- **Q: What is BETO.GROUP's burden of liability should unforeseen tempests arise?**
>The Platform is offered unto you "AS IT IS" and "AS IT IS AVAILABLE," without spoken or unspoken assurances. To the fullest extent the ancient laws permit, our burden of liability is significantly circumscribed. For example, we are generally not held to account for indirect tempests or consequential shadows, and our total aggregate burden for all claims arising from your voyage with the Platform or these Pacts is capped at the sum of **USD $88.88**. Certain realms do not permit all such limitations. We bid you consult **[[TERMS OF SERVICE#5. Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability; Indemnification|ToS Section 5]]** for the full disclaimers and limitations of our burden.

>[!info]- **Q: What if my years number less than eighteen? May I still embark upon the BETO.GROUP voyage?**
>**Nay.**Â The pathways of this Platform are forgedÂ **solely for voyagers who have seen eighteen winters**Â or have reached the age of full decree in their own lands. By embarking upon this voyage, you make a sacred and binding declaration that you meet this threshold. Any passage by one who has not seen eighteen winters is unauthorized and a breach of our pacts. [[TERMS OF SERVICE#9. ELIGIBILITY AND AGE REQUIREMENT|(ToS Section 9)]]

### **12. Whispers & Wayfinding: General Queries & Contact**

>[!info]- **Q: What is the guiding star, the "Mission Goal," of BETO.GROUP's grand quest?**
>Our sacred vow, our ever-repeating mantra, is thus: Discover, Learn, Develop, Teach, Repeat. It is an unending cycle, a spiral dance with no final destination, for BETO.GROUP itself is an instrument forever growing, an echo of our collective journey through existence.

>[!info]- **Q: I have found an unexpected anomaly (a bug) or harbor a question not illuminated within these scrolls. What path should I take?**
>For general queries, reports of anomalies, or offerings of feedback, we invite you to join our community conclave on Discord (should one be open) or send an ethereal missive to us via `contact@beto.group`. For matters concerning sacred law, privacy, infringements upon sacred marks, or the responsible unveiling of vulnerabilities, direct your missives to `legalis@beto.group`. (Guidance is found in ToS Sections [[TERMS OF SERVICE#6. Feedback|6]], [[TERMS OF SERVICE#7. User Conduct|7.1]], and [[TERMS OF SERVICE#15. Contact Information|15]]).
