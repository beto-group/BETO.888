## No logging but logging anyway policies:

Many people have the idea that privacy-oriented services such as VPN or E-Mail providers are safe due to their no-logging policies or their encryption schemes. Unfortunately, many of those same people forget that all those providers are legal commercial entities subject to the laws of the countries in which they operate.

Any of those providers can be forced to silently (without your knowing (using for example a court order with a gag order[275](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html#fn:272) or a national security letter[276](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html#fn:273)) log your activity to de-anonymize you. There have been several recent examples of those:

- 2021, Proton, Proton logged IP address of French activist after an order by Swiss authorities (source link unavailable).
    
- 2021, WindScribe, Servers were not encrypted as they should have been allowing MITM attacks by authorities[277](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html#fn:275).
    
- 2021, DoubleVPN servers, logs, and account info seized by law enforcement[278](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html#fn:276).
    
- 2021, The Germany-based mail provider Tutanota was forced to monitor specific accounts for 3 months[279](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html#fn:277).
    
- 2020, The Germany-based mail provider Tutanota was forced to implement a backdoor to intercept and save copies of the unencrypted e-mails of one user[280](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html#fn:278) (they did not decrypt the stored e-mail).
    
- 2017, PureVPN was forced to disclose information of one user to the FBI[281](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html#fn:279).
    
- 2014, an EarthVPN user was arrested based on logs provider to the Dutch Police[282](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html#fn:280).
    
- 2013, Secure E-Mail provider Lavabit shuts down after fighting a secret gag order[283](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html#fn:281).
    
- 2011, HideMyAss user was de-anonymized, and logs were provided to the FBI[284](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html#fn:282).
    

Some providers have implemented the use of a Warrant Canary[285](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html#fn:283) that would allow their users to find out if they have been compromised by such orders, but this has not been tested yet as far as we know.

Finally, it is now well known that some companies might be sponsored front ends for some state adversaries (see the Crypto AG story[286](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html#fn:284) and Omnisec story[287](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html#fn:285)).

For these reasons, you mustn’t trust such providers for your privacy despite all their claims. In most cases, you will be the last person to know if any of your accounts were targeted by such orders and you might never know at all.

To mitigate this, in cases where you want to use a VPN, we will recommend the use of a cash/Monero-paid VPN provider over Tor to prevent the VPN service from knowing any identifiable information about you.

If the VPN provider knows nothing about you, it should mitigate any issue due to them not logging but logging anyway.
