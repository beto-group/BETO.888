THE PRIZE is STILL UP FOR GRAB

The future is taking shape—perhaps closer than you all think.
But first, anyone who can reproduce this within Datacore will earn the title of [G.O.A.T.ED] 🐐 and a well-deserved prize(s) 👀.

We want do reproduce this view

### **What I'm Looking For**:

Create a circular visualization within **Obsidian Datacore**, integrating the following features for seamless functionality:

1. **Dynamic Component Integration**:
  * Embed a component directly within a note to automatically pull all underlying links.
  * Use a reference file to map and organize files, ensuring connections between categories and subcategories are clearly defined.
2. **Dynamic Display Options**:
  * Recreate the category visualization used on website and reproduce for our own vault. For example, refer to this category: [BETO.GROUP.obsidian](https://www.beto.group/obsidian).
  * Provide customizable depth levels for displayed categories, such as:
    * Displaying main categories at the top level.
    * Nesting subcategories further, with adjustable depth to control how many levels are visible.
3. **Integrated Data Source**:
  * Focus solely on displaying specific elements like "Namzu," where data is derived from a separate file.
  * Follow the naming convention of `[[topic]].namzu`, ensuring only files with this tag display their corresponding branch structure.
4. **Modularity (Bonus Points)**:

* Ensure the design and implementation remain as modular as possible, enabling seamless future adjustments or additions without affecting the existing structure. This approach ensures scalability and adaptability for evolving needs.
* **Extra Bonus**: If the Obsidian team integrates this directly into dynamic views, even more kudos to them 🤭!
