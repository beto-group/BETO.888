Post 
    Lol guy found the guy that did the component me hehe

Howdy howdy, glad to see people enjoying themselves. teehee



Created this component as a quick project and was trying to see current capabilities of datacore since they are still working on it
     See great potential. And unlimited opportunities once obsidian publish implementation becomes a thing
         Keep up the great work boy and girls ;)...

Regarding your questions about diff fields  having the possibility to be update welp that ain't working sadly tried with no success 

After releasing this component, some developper/member from datacore community were saying they are working on making properties editable so stop working on it until... Today cuz they just implemented new version
