#### INTRODUCTION

Howdy folks. Iâ€™m a long-time admirer, first-time sharer.

Welp, SHOULD have done this a long time ago since this design is supposed to beÂ `working in the open`, and I could of had continuous feedback/improvements with you all, but I like perfection, hehe. iiwii.

Iâ€™m sharing my take on zettelkasten, digital garden, pkm. As well as incorporating some building in the public and how workflows can be optimized so your thoughts and ideas can quickly turn into published content with the power of obsidian.

Here it is. Enjoy the good and the bad.

This will always be a work in progress since it will be a collection of ideas/ projects I am considering doing and designing. While allowing others to join in on the fun.Â _[based on personal experiences/preferences]_Â make your own version, feedback, criticisms, and inputs. Anything is always welcome.Â **I LIVE FOR THE FEEDBACK**

If you have any questions regarding anything that caught your attention, feel free to ask me, and Iâ€™ll either answer them or direct you in the direction I believe could help you get your answer.

ALLWAYS RemembeR. perceptions are great.  
And Iâ€™m just sharing my version hehe

beto.
