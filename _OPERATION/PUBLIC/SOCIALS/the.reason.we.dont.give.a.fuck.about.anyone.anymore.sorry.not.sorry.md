###### NAVIGATE - BACK : [[DATACORE.bounty.v01]]

OBSIDIAN FORUM is just [plain] not creative [just saying ] | perception are subjective*

 
POST GOT REMOVED TWICE 
###### first time around [we removed this]
###### [redacTED statemenT...]
```
üéÑ **MERRY CHRISTMAS** üéÅ üê¶‚Äçüî•
Here‚Äôs my gift to you all: [CHRISTMAS.c24](https://www.beto.group/c24). The NFT [part] isn‚Äôt available just yet (I‚Äôll let everyone know once it‚Äôs ready)‚Äîstill waiting on verification to finalize... oopsie!


These are enigmas[Insights] and experiences that might  üéõÔ∏è  the way you perceive reality.

```

SO tried to fix this by removing the merry christmas part and only keeping the discussion about the DATACORE request

	and STILL got flag a second time.

WOW...

[[OBSIDIAN.team]] acting up today ... lol ish ü´• üôÉ

SO GOT FLAGGED FOR :

```
**spam**: the community feels it is an advertisement, something that is overly promotional in nature instead of being useful or relevant to the topic as expected.
```

but it wasnt purely this i added a bonus for whoever took the time to look at bounty
? so bringing awareness is `SPAM` to datacore possibilities ? + free nft [they would only need to provide email lol] 
	lol obsidian doesnt even understand the implications of [[888/PROJECTS/888/_RESOURCES/VAULTS/datacore_bounty/obsidian/DATACORE|DATACORE]] 
		i guess ü§î

NO CRYPTO NEEDED [[ENIGMAS.888+|!+++]] 
	just your email : and you got nft and you can do whatever the fuck you want with it

GOT TOLD BY : [RIGMAROLE](https://forum.obsidian.md/u/rigmarole/summary) love the way you when with it tho üòâ [[SELF.god|i appreciate]] the feedback ;)
```
If you continue to post self-promotional, link-heavy, scammy NFT stuff like this, your account is going to risk being suspended. So I suggest you don‚Äôt do that.
```

###### LOL. fine on heavy linking but the rest fucking bs.  IF SHARING YOUR INFORMATION IS PROMOTION . IMMA BE DOING FOR THE REST oF mY FUCKING LIFE,,, fuck

-----

###### + on a side [note](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/affiliate-links-referral-program/23321/3) :

```
OUR comment with NOTION AFFILIATE LINK got `redacted` üï∏Ô∏è
```

###### [redacted COMMENT]
```
Got to add : how we suppose to compete [viewership - content creation] with Notion  
if they got :¬†[Join the Notion Affiliate Program¬†5](https://www.notion.com/affiliates)¬†![:eyes:] üëÄ
```

I mean ... I can clearly tell now the reason why their marketing is just none existant 
		üòπ a fucking joke üò≠

-----

LATER in the DAY
So at this point , original post got deleted , and second post was what currently link in bounty page : [link](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/datacore-request/93811)


GOT THIS ONE NOW üòπ 
	on my comment to moderator

```

```

		this point was so done but i dont give a fuck so.... i wrote back
```

```FLAG this report and said

HAHAHA it keeps going
	We responded to a Guy which was getting frustrated at MODS on FORUM 
		regarding his question being irrelevant 
			He probably didnt say it the nicest so what 
				Lets have a discussion..
					but no they shut it down
						I decide to respond with 

https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-for-coding/96982/5
	

```
Lol i feel was on that they dont care about innovation [one wrong wording / wrong placement and they gonna flag you], they in their own little world. Mods gotta do something. Trust me dont bother with forum only on occasions when you need to find something otherwise best of luck out there .

P. S : your comment most likely gonna get removed too but theres people out there trying. You just got to keep your head up and grind until they come to you.

You have a lovely rest of your day sir.¬†![:saluting_face:](https://forum.obsidian.md/images/emoji/apple/saluting_face.png?v=12 ":saluting_face:")
```


HAHA my comment also go removed hahahahhaahah


No worries sir , I will remember you [@Juksu](https://forum.obsidian.md/u/juksu/summary)
	wow they even suspended his account 
		what a joke...
			do to be fair fresh account
				but still
					worst part he was actually gonna bring some value 
						some [discussion](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/any-way-to-highlight-text-in-html-tags/97429/7) 

But nah...
	You all dont know how to run a FORUM 
		thats just my opinion

LOL it keeps going!
	hahahah

So created this post was able to view I wanted done within OBSIDIAN . fuck yeah
https://forum.obsidian.md/t/proving-the-little-helpers-wrong/98848

here the post content
```
Here's my latest creation utlizing Datacore, was able to create a new way to experience my website. #wip
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UvjBq09olQ

but wrote inside
If you‚Äôre wondering about the title‚Äîit‚Äôs because the mods shut down my original request for something like¬†[this](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/datacore-request/93811). Apparently, forward-thinking ideas weren‚Äôt quite welcome at the time. Smh¬†ü§¶. But hey‚Äîbuilt it anyway. Creativity doesn‚Äôt wait for approval.
```


And they had the audacity to remove my post for **inappropriate**. ?? wow truly disappointed
	whats inappropriate? mods not making the right decision back then and now regretting their decision and now you want to hide mistake?
