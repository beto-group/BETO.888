This Section outlines the definitive licensing terms for all software provided by BETO.GROUP, including but not limited to our packaged Obsidian vaults, code components, and scripts (hereinafter collectively referred to as a "Release").

**1.1. Governing License: The MIT License**
For the avoidance of doubt, every Release made available by BETO.GROUP, regardless of its version or date of availability, is provided to you exclusively under the terms of the **<a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT License</a>**.
This is a single, perpetual license grant. There are no alternative licenses, elective paths, or time-based transitions. By downloading, accessing, or using any Release, you irrevocably agree to be bound by the terms of the MIT License as set forth herein and in the LICENSE file accompanying each Release.

This notice will be provided within a LICENSE or LICENSE.md file included with every Release. Failure to include this notice and the license text is a breach of the license terms.

**1.4. Third-Party Components and Dependencies**
A Release may be designed to function with, or may include recommendations for, third-party software, plugins, or libraries (e.g., the Obsidian.md application, community-developed Obsidian plugins like Dataview or Excalidraw, or other external tools). You acknowledge and agree that:
**(a) Separate Licensing:** The MIT License granted by BETO.GROUP applies **only** to the original code and content created by BETO.GROUP. It does not extend to, nor does it supersede, the license of any third-party component.

To ensure clarity and ease of compliance, BETO.GROUP will include a copy of the full MIT License text and the applicable copyright notice in a file named LICENSE or LICENSE.md within each Release. This file shall be the controlling legal text for the license grant.

**1.8. Legal Consultation**
While the MIT License is widely understood, if you intend to incorporate a Release into a complex commercial product or have specific compliance questions, consulting with a legal professional familiar with open-source licensing is always advisable.

## **2. The Reciprocity Ethos: A Statement of Community Principle**

**2.1. Preamble: Our Foundational Philosophy**

BETO.GROUP is fundamentally an open-source project built upon a philosophy of mutual support, shared knowledge, and ecosystem sustainability. The very existence of this Platform relies on the vast commons of open-source software, permissive licenses, and the collaborative spirit of creators. Accordingly, we believe that a core principle of our community should be **Reciprocity**: the voluntary act of giving back to the ecosystem from which value is drawn.

This Section 2 does **not** create a legally binding financial obligation, a contractual duty to contribute, or a prerequisite for using the Platform. It is a formal declaration of our community's guiding ethos. By participating in the BETO.GROUP Platform, you acknowledge this ethos and are encouraged, in good faith, to embrace its principles as a member of our community.

**2.2. The Reciprocity Expectation**

We hold a strong, good-faith expectation that any User who derives significant value from their use of the BETO.GROUP Platform will endeavor to participate in the Reciprocity Ethos. "Significant Value" is intentionally a broad concept, encompassing not only financial success but also:
- **Substantial Creative Output:** Using the Platform as a foundational tool to produce a significant body of work.
- **Educational Advancement:** Leveraging the Platform to achieve significant learning or teaching milestones.
- **Community Building:** Utilizing the Platform to build and foster your own community or project.
- **Commercial Success:** Directly or indirectly incorporating the Platform into a for-profit commercial activity that achieves a level of success where giving back becomes a feasible and proportionate action.

**2.3. Forms of Reciprocal Contribution**

A core tenet of this ethos is flexibility. A "Reciprocal Contribution" is any action that enriches the commons or supports the sustainability of the ecosystem. We explicitly value non-monetary contributions as being of equal or greater importance than financial ones. Acceptable forms of Reciprocal Contribution include, but are not limited to:
**(a) Open-Source Code Contribution:** Submitting bug fixes, performance improvements, or new features as pull requests to the BETO.GROUP open-source repositories or to other key open-source dependencies the Platform relies on.
**(b) Open-Content Creation:** Creating and sharing high-quality tutorials, comprehensive guides, educational videos, or workflow examples under a permissive license (e.g., Creative Commons) to benefit the entire community.
**(c) Community Mentorship and Support:** Dedicating consistent and substantive time to helping other users in official community channels (e.g., Discord), answering questions, troubleshooting issues, and fostering a welcoming and collaborative environment.
**(d) Independent Tooling and Integration:** Developing and open-sourcing compatible tools, plugins, or scripts that enhance the BETO.GROUP ecosystem for all users.
**(e) Voluntary Financial Contribution:** If, and only if, a User achieves significant financial success and has the means, making a voluntary, non-refundable donation to support the operational costs of BETO.GROUP or to other designated open-source projects that are critical to the Platform's infrastructure.

**2.4. BETO.GROUP's Commitment to Reciprocity**

BETO.GROUP, as the steward of this Platform, commits to upholding this ethos through its own actions. We pledge to:

**(a) Lead by Example:** Once the Platform achieves operational sustainability through community support, BETO.GROUP will allocate a portion of its resources (financial or developmental) to make Reciprocal Contributions back to the key open-source projects and dependencies that form our foundation.
**(b) Maintain Transparency:** We will publicly document our own Reciprocal Contributions and maintain a "Dependencies & Gratitude" notice acknowledging the projects we rely on.
**(c) Foster and Recognize Contribution:** We will actively work to create pathways and recognition systems (as described in Section 2.5) that empower and celebrate all forms of community contribution.

**2.5. Community Recognition for Participation in the Ethos**

While participation in the Reciprocity Ethos is not mandatory, BETO.GROUP will strive to formally recognize and reward users who tangibly demonstrate their commitment to these principles. Such recognition is a discretionary "thank you" from the community and may include:

**(a) Public Acknowledgment:** With the User's consent, featuring their contributions and projects on the BETO.GROUP website or in community announcements.
**(b) Community Status and NFT Tiers:** Awarding special community roles, badges, or higher-tiered NFTs (as defined in Section 3) to Users who make significant or sustained Reciprocal Contributions, whether monetary or non-monetary. The criteria for such recognition will be made available through our community channels.
**(c) Access to Development Channels:** Inviting consistent, high-quality contributors to private channels to collaborate more closely on the future direction of the Platform.

**2.6. Distinction from Legal or Contractual Obligation**

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 2 shall be interpreted as follows:

**(a) Non-Binding in Nature:** The "Reciprocity Expectation" is a moral and ethical guideline, not a legally enforceable duty. Failure to make a Reciprocal Contribution does not, in itself, constitute a breach of these Terms.
**(b) No Link to Platform Access:** A User's access to or use of the Platform is not conditional upon their participation in the Reciprocity Ethos. All core software and features will remain accessible as described in these Terms, regardless of a User's decision to contribute.
**(c) No Creation of Financial Liability:** This section does not create any form of debt, royalty, revenue-sharing obligation, or other financial liability for any User. All financial contributions made in the spirit of this ethos are legally considered voluntary, non-refundable donations.

## 3. Digital Collectibles (NFTs), Utility, and Associated Rights

BETO.GROUP may offer or utilize Non-Fungible Tokens (“NFTs” or "Digital Collectibles") as part of its Platform. These are unique digital assets recorded on a blockchain network (the "Applicable Blockchain Network"). This section outlines our philosophy for utilizing NFTs, the methods for acquiring them, and the nature of the benefits they provide.

**3.1. Purpose and Acquisition of BETO.GROUP NFTs**
**BETO.GROUP NFTs primarily function as a user account system and a method for recognizing and rewarding a User's engagement and contribution to our community. These Digital Collectibles are not offered for sale by BETO.GROUP.** Users may acquire a base-level NFT and potentially achieve higher-tiered NFTs through various methods designed to encourage participation and support.
**(a) Base-Tier NFT (e.g., "Participant"):** All users are eligible to acquire a base-tier NFT, which serves as their primary account identifier. The acquisition of a base-tier NFT is available through non-monetary means, including but not limited to:
- **Free Claim:** Minting the NFT for free from our Website (where the User is solely responsible for any applicable blockchain transaction fees, or "gas fees," which are not paid to BETO.GROUP).
- **Initial Community Engagement:** Joining our official community channels or participating in introductory activities.
**(b) Higher-Tier NFTs (e.g., "Contributor," "Patron"):** Higher-tiered NFTs, which may unlock additional community recognition or benefits, are awarded based on a User's demonstrated and sustained commitment to the BETO.GROUP ecosystem. **Achieving a higher tier is primarily based on non-monetary contributions.** The criteria for earning a higher-tiered NFT may include, but are not limited to:
- **Technical Contributions:** Submitting validated bug reports or contributing code via our open-source repositories.
- **Community Support:** Actively assisting other users, moderating discussions, or creating valuable community resources (e.g., tutorials, guides).
**(c) Recognition of Voluntary Support:** As a token of our appreciation, Users who choose to provide a **voluntary, non-refundable donation** to support the ongoing development of the Platform may be gifted an NFT commensurate with their level of engagement and support. The acquisition of an NFT in this context is a **discretionary gift** from BETO.GROUP in recognition of support and is not a product being purchased.
**(d) Discretion and Non-Monetary Path:** The specific criteria for each tier and the method of awarding NFTs are determined at BETO.GROUP's sole discretion and will be communicated through our official community channels or website. **The availability of a non-monetary path to achieve any tier is a core principle of this system.**

**3.2. Utility, Perks, and Access Rights**
**(a) Nature of Utility:** An NFT may grant the holder "Utility," which primarily includes community-oriented privileges or benefits ("Perks") as recognition for the User's status within the community. Perks may include, but are not limited to:
- Cosmetic benefits, such as special roles or badges on community platforms.
- Access to exclusive community channels for discussion.
- The ability to participate in community governance, such as voting on future initiatives.
- Eligibility for access to special community events (online or in-person).
**(b) No Paywalled Core Functionality:** For the avoidance of doubt, core Platform functionality, including the features of the primary software Releases, is **not permanently gated or paywalled** behind any NFT tier. The standard, fully functional version of our software is available to all users, regardless of their NFT tier.
**(c) Platform Dependence:** Many Utilities, especially those requiring interaction with BETO.GROUP-controlled systems ("Platform-dependent Utility"), depend on your continued authorized access to and good standing on the BETO.GROUP Platform. Termination of your Platform access may impact your ability to realize such Utilities. **For example, if your general Platform access is terminated, you might lose any special Discord server roles, or access to exclusive website content that was tied to your NFT ownership via Platform verification.** (A more detailed explanation and further examples are provided in Section 8.2(c)).

**3.3. License to Associated Art/Content (Not Ownership of IP)**  
**It is crucial to understand that your ownership of a BETO.GROUP NFT grants you ownership of the specific digital token recorded on the Applicable Blockchain Network and the specific license rights to any Associated Art/Content as detailed below. It does not grant you ownership of the underlying intellectual property (e.g., copyright, trademarks) in the Associated Art/Content or any other BETO.GROUP IP, all of which are retained by BETO.GROUP (or its licensors) as further detailed in Section 3.4.**

If a BETO.GROUP NFT has digital artwork or creative content specifically created by BETO.GROUP and linked to it ("Associated Art/Content"), the following license terms apply to the lawful holder of that NFT, subject to your continued compliance with these Terms:  
**(a) Personal Use License:** You are granted a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, copy, and display the Associated Art/Content for your personal, non-commercial enjoyment.  
**(b) Broad Commercial Use License:** You are also granted an unlimited, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the Associated Art/Content to create derivative works for "Commercial Use." This includes, for example, producing and selling merchandise (like T-shirts or prints) displaying the Associated Art/Content or incorporating it into your own digital or physical projects.  
**(c) Clarifications on Commercial Use:** This Commercial Use license allows you to:  
(i) Own or operate a marketplace for BETO.GROUP NFTs, provided it cryptographically verifies ownership for displaying Associated Art/Content.  
(ii) Own or operate a third-party website/application that includes BETO.GROUP NFTs, provided it cryptographically verifies ownership for displaying Associated Art/Content and removes the display if you leave the site/application.  
(iii) Earn revenue from the above activities.  
**(d) Restrictions on Use:** You agree not to use any Associated Art/Content in connection with media depicting hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, illegal activities, or anything constituting hate speech, infringing on others' rights, or likely to bring BETO.GROUP or its community into disrepute.  
**(e) Third-Party Platform Reliance:** The process of claiming, receiving, or interacting with an NFT may rely on third-party platforms (e.g., tools for airdropping or minting). BETO.GROUP is not responsible for these platforms' operations, security, or policies.

**3.4. Intellectual Property Ownership (BETO.GROUP IP) 
You acknowledge that BETO.GROUP (or its licensors) owns all legal right, title, and interest in and to any Associated Art/Content, and all intellectual property rights therein (e.g., copyright, trademarks), as well as in the BETO.GROUP name, logos, and other branding, **and all original content, templates, structures, and methodologies provided within BETO.GROUP software Releases** ("BETO.GROUP IP"). Your rights to Associated Art/Content are strictly limited to the licenses expressly granted in Section 3.3. All other rights are reserved by BETO.GROUP. Your use of BETO.GROUP IP (beyond the licensed display of Associated Art/Content) requires our express permission and adherence to our branding guidelines. Please also refer to Section 5.7
regarding our policies on unintentional infringement and the procedure for alleged copyright infringement concerning Platform assets, including Associated Art/Content.

**3.5. Key Risks and Disclaimers Specific to NFTs**  
Your use of BETO.GROUP NFTs involves inherent risks. Please understand that:  
**(a) "AS IS" Provision:** NFTs, Smart Contracts, associated utilities, and any third-party minting/distribution platforms (like Crossmint) are provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE," without warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, utility, or non-infringement.  
**(b) Blockchain Technology Risks:** You risk hardware/software/internet failures, malware, smart contract vulnerabilities, and unauthorized wallet access. BETO.GROUP is not responsible for blockchain network failures, errors, or delays, nor for losses from user error (e.g., lost passwords), smart contract issues, or third-party attacks.  
**(c) Regulatory Uncertainty & Changes in Law:** The legal and regulatory framework governing digital assets, blockchain technology, and Non-Fungible Tokens remains highly uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially and adversely affect the development of the Platform and the utility or value of your Digital Collectibles. You understand and agree that **BETO.GROUP is not liable for any loss, damage, or inability to use or realize the Utility or value of your NFTs due to any changes in applicable laws, regulations, or policies that may impact their use, transferability, legality, or value after your acquisition.**
**(d) No Financial Advice:** Information from BETO.GROUP about NFTs is not financial advice.  
**(e) Third-Party Platform Reliance:** Minting, distribution, or trading may rely on third-party platforms (e.g., Crossmint, OpenSea). BETO.GROUP is not responsible for these platforms' operations, security, or policies.
**(f) User's Tax and Compliance Obligations:** You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your NFT-related transactions, including but not limited to any acquisition, transfer, or realization of value in connection with your Digital Collectibles. You are also solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws in your jurisdiction, including but not limited to any anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorist financing (CTF), or economic sanctions requirements. **BETO.GROUP does not provide legal, tax, or financial advice. We strongly advise you to consult with a qualified legal and tax professional in your jurisdiction to understand your personal obligations before engaging in any transactions involving Digital Collectibles.** BETO.GROUP will not be responsible for withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting any taxes arising from your participation in the Platform.

**Exclusion:** Notwithstanding the foregoing, your indemnification obligations under this Section 5.6 shall not extend to any Claims to the extent that such Claims are proven to have arisen primarily and directly from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of BETO.GROUP or its Indemnified Parties.

BETO.GROUP reserves the right, at its own expense (subject to your indemnification obligation for other costs if the claim falls within your responsibility), to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate fully with BETO.GROUP in asserting any available defenses. You agree not to settle any matter for which you have an indemnification obligation without the prior written consent of BETO.GROUP.

**5.7. Intellectual Property Rights in Platform Assets (including NFT Associated Art/Content) and Procedure for Alleged Copyright Infringement**  
**(a) Creation of Assets:** BETO.GROUP endeavors to create original visual assets for the Platform. This includes, but is not limited to, visuals within any "Assets Library," those provided as part of downloadable software Releases, and **any "Associated Art/Content" linked to BETO.GROUP Digital Collectibles (NFTs) as defined in Section 3.1.** The creative process for some assets involves the interpretation, re-drawing, or transformative adaptation of existing concepts or publicly available materials, utilizing digital creation tools (such as Excalidraw), with the goal of producing new, distinct expressions. BETO.GROUP offers these assets in good faith, under the belief that they constitute original creations or fall within the scope of permissible transformative use.  
**(b) No Warranty Against Unintentional Infringement:** Despite our efforts, due to the nature of creative inspiration and the vast amount of existing visual material, BETO.GROUP cannot and does not warrant that all visual assets provided on the Platform, **including Associated Art/Content for NFTs,** are entirely free from any unintentional resemblance to, or infringement upon, third-party copyrighted works or other intellectual property rights.  
**(c) Notice and Takedown Procedure for Alleged Copyright Infringement:** BETO.GROUP respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any content or asset available on the Platform, **including any Associated Art/Content for a BETO.GROUP NFT,** infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the following procedure. Please provide our designated Copyright Agent ([legalis@beto.group](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=mailto%3Alegalis%40beto.group)) with the following information in writing (a "Notice of Alleged Infringement"):  
(i) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  
(ii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works.  
(iii) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit BETO.GROUP to locate the material (e.g., a URL to the page, a clear description of where the asset can be found within a specific Release, **or the name/ID of the specific NFT and a description of its Associated Art/Content**).  
(iv) Information reasonably sufficient to permit BETO.GROUP to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address.  
(v) A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.  
(vi) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  
**(d) BETO.GROUP's Response to Notices:** Upon receipt of a compliant Notice of Alleged Infringement, BETO.GROUP will:  
(i) Expeditiously investigate the claim.  
(ii) If BETO.GROUP determines in its reasonable discretion that an infringement may have occurred, it will remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material from the Platform. **If the allegedly infringing material is Associated Art/Content for an NFT, BETO.GROUP may also take steps to disassociate or update the metadata for that NFT on platforms it controls to reflect the removal or change, where technically feasible, and may publicly note the status of the contested art.**  
(iii) BETO.GROUP may, at its discretion, notify the user who provided or is associated with the allegedly infringing material (if applicable and identifiable) or the current holder of an NFT whose Associated Art/Content is contested, and provide them with an opportunity to submit a counter-notification if they believe the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification.  
(iv) BETO.GROUP reserves the right to terminate access for users who are found to be repeat infringers, or to take action against NFTs whose Associated Art/Content is repeatedly found to be infringing, in appropriate circumstances.  
**(e) Limitation of Liability for Unintentional Infringement:** To the maximum extent permitted by law, BETO.GROUP shall not be liable for any direct or indirect damages arising from any unintentional infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by assets provided on the Platform, **including Associated Art/Content for NFTs.** Our sole obligation in such an event, upon receipt of a valid Notice of Alleged Infringement, will be to investigate and, if deemed appropriate, take action regarding the contested material as described above.  
**(f) User Responsibility:** If you use assets from the Platform, **including Associated Art/Content from BETO.GROUP NFTs,** in your own projects, derivative works, or for commercial purposes (as permitted under Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for ensuring that your specific use of those assets complies with all applicable laws and does not infringe upon any third-party rights. Your license to use Associated Art/Content (as per Section 3.3) is granted subject to the condition that such use is lawful and non-infringing.

## 6. Feedback

**6.1. Submission of Feedback:**  
BETO.GROUP welcomes and encourages your feedback, comments, ideas, suggestions, improvements, or materials you submit concerning the Platform (collectively, “Feedback”). You may submit Feedback through various channels, including but not limited to:  
**(a) Email:** Directly to contact@beto.group.  
**(b) Community Channels:** Through official BETO.GROUP community platforms (e.g., Discord server, designated forums), as guided by those platforms’ rules.  
We particularly value Feedback in the form of bug reports, clear feature ideas, usability suggestions, or community-driven initiatives that align with BETO.GROUP's mission.

**6.2. Nature of Feedback and License to BETO.GROUP:**  
You acknowledge and agree that all Feedback you provide will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary to you. By submitting Feedback, you hereby grant BETO.GROUP a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, non-exclusive, transferable, and fully sublicensable right and license to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, create derivative works from, integrate into its Platform, transmit, distribute, and otherwise exploit such Feedback in any manner and for any purpose, including for commercial purposes, without compensation, attribution, or restriction to you. This license grant allows BETO.GROUP to freely incorporate and act upon your Feedback to improve or develop its Platform and services.

**6.3. User's Retention of Ownership in Underlying Ideas:**  
The license granted to BETO.GROUP in Section 6.2 pertains to the Feedback as submitted by you. To the extent that your Feedback contains original ideas, concepts, or inventions in which you hold pre-existing intellectual property rights (such as patentable inventions or original copyrighted works that exist independently of the Feedback submitted), you retain ownership of such underlying pre-existing intellectual property rights. However, your submission of Feedback grants BETO.GROUP the broad license described above to use the Feedback itself, including any suggestions or expressions of those ideas, as part of our development and improvement processes. BETO.GROUP’s use of your Feedback under the granted license does not, in itself, transfer ownership of your separately protected, pre-existing intellectual property to BETO.GROUP, unless a separate written agreement (such as an IP assignment agreement) is entered into.

**6.4. No Obligation to Use:**  
BETO.GROUP is under no obligation to use, implement, or act upon any Feedback it receives. The decision to do so is at BETO.GROUP’s sole discretion.

**6.5. Rewards for Feedback:**  
BETO.GROUP may, at its sole discretion, offer rewards, recognition, or compensation for Feedback it deems exceptionally valuable or for significant contributions ("big-picture ideas"). Any such rewards or compensation shall be subject to a separate written agreement between you and BETO.GROUP, if applicable.

(c) **Intellectual Property Infringement:** Uploading, posting, sharing, or distributing content that violates or infringes upon the copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights of any party **(e.g., including commercially licensed themes or plugins within a shared vault without the necessary rights, or using BETO.GROUP’s logo on your own derivative work in a way that implies official endorsement)**; using BETO.GROUP IP (as defined in Section 3.4) without express permission or in a manner not authorized by these Terms or applicable law; falsely claiming authorship of, or endorsement by, BETO.GROUP for content or modifications you create or distribute.  
(d) **Harassment and Harmful Behavior:** Harassing, threatening, bullying, stalking, or intimidating others; posting or transmitting defamatory, libelous, obscene, pornographic, discriminatory, or violent content; promoting harmful misinformation, pseudo-science, or dangerous practices based on misinterpretation or misuse of Platform content **(e.g., using information from a BETO.GROUP vault discussing historical financial events to promote a guaranteed "get rich quick" scheme)**.  
(e) **Spam and Unsolicited Communications:** Sending unsolicited bulk messages, promotions, advertisements, chain letters, spam, or pyramid schemes; harvesting user contact information for unsolicited purposes.  
(f) **NFT-Specific Misconduct:** Manipulating or "wash trading" BETO.GROUP NFTs on any platform **(e.g., repeatedly buying and selling the same BETO.GROUP NFT between accounts you control to artificially inflate its perceived market value or trading volume)**; creating or distributing counterfeit BETO.GROUP NFTs or Associated Art/Content; using BETO.GROUP NFTs or Associated Art/Content in a way that violates the license terms granted in Section 3.3, or for fraudulent or deceptive purposes; attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in any BETO.GROUP NFT Smart Contracts.  
(g) **Impersonation and Misrepresentation:** Impersonating any person or entity, or falsely stating or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, or the source of any information you provide **(e.g., creating a support forum profile that mimics a BETO.GROUP staff member to solicit private information from other users)**.  
(h) **Interference and Abuse of Service:** Disrupting or interfering with the operation, functionality, or security of the Platform (e.g., via DDoS attacks); circumventing security measures, access controls, or rate limits.  
(i) **Unauthorized Use of Data:** Scraping, mining, or otherwise extracting data from the Platform in violation of these Terms or applicable law **(e.g., systematically downloading all user-contributed notes from a shared community vault for republication on another platform without consent)**; using harvested data to compete with BETO.GROUP or to train machine learning models without BETO.GROUP's explicit prior written authorization. 
(j) **Financial and Commercial Misconduct:** Engaging in money laundering, illicit financial transactions, or bribery related to the use of the Platform or BETO.GROUP NFTs.  
(k) **Privacy Violations:** Collecting, using, misusing, or disclosing the personal data of other users or individuals without their consent or proper legal basis; sharing private communications without permission; **or otherwise failing to respect the privacy of others within the BETO.GROUP community (e.g., scraping user profiles from community platforms like Discord for unsolicited marketing or data compilation).**  
(l) **Circumventing Limitations:** Bypassing usage limits, payment requirements (if any), or attempting to interfere with license enforcement mechanisms for software or Digital Collectibles **(e.g., attempting to remove or obscure the required copyright and license notices from a software Release)**.
(m) **Other Harmful Activities:** Engaging in any other activity that BETO.GROUP, in its sole and reasonable discretion, deems to be: (i) harmful, disruptive, or detrimental to the Platform, its operations, or its infrastructure **(e.g., intentionally submitting excessively large files or queries designed to degrade Platform performance for other users)**; (ii) harmful or offensive to other Users or the BETO.GROUP community **(e.g., promoting conspiracy theories known to cause real-world harm or distress within community channels)**; (iii) damaging to BETO.GROUP's reputation or goodwill **(e.g., systematically spreading false or malicious information about BETO.GROUP or its Platform)**; or (iv) otherwise in violation of the spirit or intent of these Terms or any applicable community guidelines that BETO.GROUP may publish from time to time.
**(n) Violation of Third-Party Terms via Integrated Tools:** Using any integrated Platform tools (such as the media player) to access, use, or interact with content from a third-party service in a manner that you know, or should reasonably know, violates the Terms of Service, license, or intellectual property rights of that third-party service.

**7.1. Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure:** If you discover a security vulnerability in the Platform or any BETO.GROUP Smart Contract, you agree to report it privately and responsibly to BETO.GROUP at legalis@beto.group without exploiting it or disclosing it publicly until BETO.GROUP has had a reasonable opportunity to address it. Adherence to responsible disclosure practices may, at BETO.GROUP’s sole discretion, be eligible for rewards or recognition. Unauthorized attempts to exploit vulnerabilities may result in termination of your Platform access and potential legal action. This does not constitute permission to probe, test, or attempt to breach the security of the Platform without explicit written authorization from BETO.GROUP.

## 8. Termination

**8.1. Termination by BETO.GROUP**
**(a) Grounds for Termination or Suspension for Material Breach:**  
BETO.GROUP may, at its sole discretion, suspend or terminate your access to and use of the Platform (excluding your ownership rights to any lawfully acquired BETO.GROUP NFTs on the Applicable Blockchain Network, but potentially including any Platform-dependent Utility of such NFTs as detailed in Section 8.2(c)) for any **"material breach"** of these Terms. A **"material breach"** is understood as a significant violation of these Terms that harms or has the potential to harm BETO.GROUP, other users, the integrity or security of the Platform, or fundamentally undermines the parties' agreement. For the purposes of this Section, material breaches include, but are not limited to, the specific grounds listed below:  
(i) Violation of the User Conduct provisions (Section 7), particularly those involving illegal activities, security compromises, intellectual property infringement, or severe harassment;  
(ii) A significant or repeated breach of the terms governing Digital Collectibles (Section 3);  
(iii) Engagement in illegal, fraudulent, or other activities that cause significant harm through or in connection with the Platform;  
(iv) Intentional or repeated circumvention of security measures or Platform usage policies;  
(v) Failure to comply with applicable laws in your use of the Platform in a manner that exposes BETO.GROUP to significant legal or financial risk; or  
(vi) Causing significant actual harm or posing an imminent risk of such harm to BETO.GROUP, its systems, its users, or third parties.
**(b) Notice and Opportunity to Cure (for certain material breaches):**  
(i) **Immediate Action for Severe Breaches:** Notwithstanding Section 8.1(b)(ii), BETO.GROUP reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access **immediately and without prior notice or opportunity to cure** if the material breach, in BETO.GROUP's reasonable determination, involves illegal activities (e.g., Section 8.1(a)(iii)), poses an imminent security threat (e.g., Section 8.1(a)(iv)), causes or is highly likely to cause significant and irreparable harm to BETO.GROUP or others (e.g., Section 8.1(a)(vi)), or demonstrates a clear pattern of willful or repeated non-compliance.  
(ii) **Discretionary Opportunity to Cure:** For other material breaches not falling under Section 8.1(b)(i), BETO.GROUP **may, at its sole discretion and depending on the nature and severity of the breach, offer you** written notice of the breach and a period of **up to thirty (30) calendar days (or a shorter period if BETO.GROUP reasonably determines that the circumstances warrant a more expedited resolution)** from the date of notice to cure such breach ("Cure Period"). If a Cure Period is offered and you fail to cure the breach to BETO.GROUP's reasonable satisfaction within the specified Cure Period, BETO.GROUP may then proceed with suspension or termination of your access. **The decision to offer a Cure Period, and its length, is at BETO.GROUP's sole discretion.**  
(iii) **Warnings for Minor Violations:** Separately, for conduct deemed a minor violation as described in Section 8.4(a), BETO.GROUP may issue a warning before any further action.
**(c) Nature of Action:**  
The decision to suspend versus terminate, or to provide a Cure Period, will be made by BETO.GROUP in its reasonable discretion, based on the nature, severity, and impact of the breach, your history with the Platform, and any attempts made by you to rectify the situation.

**8.2. Effect of Termination of Platform Access:**  
**(a) Cessation of Platform Use:**  
Upon termination of your Platform access, your right to use and access the BETO.GROUP-controlled aspects of the Platform (e.g., Website, proprietary online services, community channels if linked to platform use, access to new software Releases) will immediately cease.
**(b) Software and Proprietary Materials:**  
Termination of your Platform access **does not revoke or alter the license** for any software Release you lawfully obtained prior to the termination date. Your ongoing rights to use, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of such previously obtained Releases remain perpetually governed by the terms of the MIT License as detailed in Section 1. However, your right to obtain new Releases or updates via the Platform will be terminated.
**(c) BETO.GROUP NFTs:**  
(i) **Ownership:** Termination of your access to the Platform does not, in itself, affect your ownership of any BETO.GROUP NFTs you lawfully possess on the Applicable Blockchain Network.  
(ii) **Associated Rights & Utility:** Unless the termination is due to a direct and severe violation of Section 3 (Digital Collectibles) or a breach that fundamentally undermines the integrity of the NFT ecosystem, your license rights to any Associated Art/Content tied to your lawfully owned BETO.GROUP NFTs (as granted in Section 3.3) shall generally survive termination, subject to your ongoing compliance with the terms of those licenses.

However, any **Platform-dependent Utility** of your BETO.GROUP NFTs **will be revoked, suspended, or cease to function upon termination of your Platform access.** This is because such Utilities rely on your continued authorized access to and interaction with the BETO.GROUP Platform itself. "Platform-dependent Utility" refers to benefits or functionalities that require an active, non-terminated account or connection to BETO.GROUP's controlled systems. Examples include, but are not limited to:
- Gated Access to Digital Content (e.g., exclusive sections of the Website or private forums).
- Community Privileges (e.g., special roles or permissions in managed community platforms).
- Software or Feature Unlocks within the Platform.
- Eligibility for Future Benefits distributed via the Platform (e.g., airdrops, early access).
- Platform-Based Governance (e.g., participation in voting mechanisms on the Platform).
- Redemption of any benefits through a BETO.GROUP-controlled portal.
Essentially, if a utility or benefit tied to your NFT requires you to log in to, interact with, or be recognized by BETO.GROUP's proprietary systems, that utility is Platform-dependent and may be lost if your access to the Platform is terminated.  
(iii) **Revocation for Severe Breaches:** Notwithstanding the foregoing, BETO.GROUP reserves the right, in cases of severe or repeated material breaches of these Terms, particularly those involving intellectual property infringement related to Associated Art/Content or misuse of NFT Utility for prohibited activities, to publicly declare that the licenses and Platform-dependent Utilities associated with specific BETO.GROUP NFTs held by a breaching party are revoked or suspended. While BETO.GROUP cannot seize the NFT itself from the blockchain, such a declaration may impact the NFT's perceived value or usability within the BETO.GROUP ecosystem.
**(d) No Refunds:**  
No refunds or compensation will be provided upon termination of Platform access, except as may be expressly required by applicable law for any Purchased Products (as per Section 10).
**(e) Remedies:**  
Termination does not limit any of BETO.GROUP’s other rights or remedies available at law or in equity.

**8.3. Survival:**  
The following Sections shall survive any termination or expiration of these Terms, as their terms and the rights and obligations they contain are intended to operate indefinitely or to address matters that arise post-termination: the Preamble, Section 1 (Software Licensing Model, as it perpetually governs any Releases you have obtained), Section 2 (The Reciprocity Ethos, as a statement of principle), Section 3 (Digital Collectibles, particularly regarding ownership, intellectual property, and ongoing license terms for NFTs held post-termination, as qualified by Section 8.2(c)), Section 5 (Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability; Indemnification), Section 6 (Feedback), Section 10 (Purchases and Payments, regarding any transactions made prior to termination), Section 11 (Modification of Terms), Section 12 (Governing Law and Dispute Resolution), Section 13 (Agreement to Terms), Section 14 (Miscellaneous Legal Provisions), Section 15 (Contact Information), and this Section 8.3 (Survival).

**8.4. Warnings and Appeals Process**  
**(a) Warnings for Minor Breaches:** BETO.GROUP aims to foster a positive and compliant community. For certain conduct that BETO.GROUP, in its reasonable discretion, deems to be a minor or unintentional first-time violation of these Terms, BETO.GROUP may, but is not obligated to, issue a warning or request corrective action before resorting to suspension or termination of Platform access. Repeated minor violations after a warning may be considered a material breach. The decision to issue a warning instead of immediate termination is at BETO.GROUP’s sole discretion and depends on the nature and severity of the violation.  
**(b) Appeal of Termination:** If your access to the Platform has been terminated by BETO.GROUP, you may appeal this decision by contacting legalis@beto.group within thirty (30) calendar days of receiving the termination notice. Your appeal should include your username or other identifier, the reasons for your appeal, and any supporting evidence or explanation you wish to provide.  
**(c) Appeal Review:** BETO.GROUP will review timely appeals in good faith. The review process may involve re-evaluating the information leading to the termination and any new information provided in the appeal. **If BETO.GROUP, in its sole discretion, determines that the appeal is successful, potential outcomes may include, but are not limited to, reinstatement of your access to the Platform, modification of the initial action taken, or other appropriate remedies as deemed suitable by BETO.GROUP.** However, BETO.GROUP is not obligated to reinstate access or take any specific action even if new information is presented, and the decision following an appeal review will be considered final with respect to BETO.GROUP's internal appeals process. We will endeavor to respond to appeals within a reasonable timeframe, typically within thirty (30) days of receipt of a complete appeal, but this timeframe is not guaranteed.
**(d) No Suspension of Termination:** Submitting an appeal does not automatically suspend the termination. Your access will remain terminated while the appeal is under review, unless BETO.GROUP expressly states otherwise.  
**(e) Scope:** This appeals process applies to termination of Platform access. It may not apply to other actions BETO.GROUP might take, such as content removal or warnings that do not involve termination of overall Platform access.

**8.5. Platform Discontinuation and Commitment to Community Continuity**
**(a) Right to Discontinue:** BETO.GROUP reserves the right to modify, suspend, or permanently discontinue the Platform, or any part of its services, at its sole discretion for any reason, including but not limited to business, technical, or legal considerations. We will endeavor to provide reasonable advance notice of any permanent discontinuation on our Website and, where feasible, via email to our users.
**(b) Effect on Platform-Dependent Utility:** You expressly acknowledge and agree that in the event of a permanent discontinuation of the Platform, any and all **Platform-dependent Utility** (as defined in Section 8.2(c)) associated with your BETO.GROUP NFTs will permanently cease to function. The value and utility of your NFTs may be materially and adversely affected. BETO.GROUP shall not be liable to you or any third party for any loss or damage arising from such discontinuation. This cessation of utility will not affect your ownership of the NFT itself on the Applicable Blockchain Network or the license rights to its Associated Art/Content as granted in Section 3.3.
**(c) Commitment to Community Continuity:** In alignment with our Reciprocity Ethos (Section 2) and our fundamental commitment to open-source principles, in the event of a planned, permanent discontinuation of the Platform, BETO.GROUP will endeavor to take the following steps to empower the community to continue the project independently:
- (i) **Final Open-Source Release:** We will undertake to package and release the final version of our core software, including our Obsidian vaults and any non-sensitive, proprietary platform code or tools developed by us, under the full terms of the MIT License to ensure the community has the latest and most complete foundation to build upon.
-  (ii) **Public Archive of Assets:** We will aim to create and make available a public, downloadable archive containing all relevant public documentation, guides, and non-personal community resources to preserve the project's knowledge base.
- (iii) **Transition Guidance:** Where technically feasible, we will publish guidance or documentation on how the community could potentially self-host, maintain, or continue development of key components of the project.
**(d) Disclaimer of Obligation:** You acknowledge that the steps outlined in Section 8.5(c) are a statement of our good-faith intentions and not a legally binding contractual obligation. The specific actions taken will depend on the circumstances of the discontinuation (e.g., an orderly wind-down versus a sudden cessation). BETO.GROUP makes no warranty or representation that a community-led continuation of the project will be feasible or successful.

## 9. ELIGIBILITY AND AGE REQUIREMENT

**9.1. Minimum Age of Use and Representation:**  
The Platform is intended solely for use by individuals who are **eighteen (18) years of age or older**, or the age of legal majority in their jurisdiction if higher than 18 ("Age of Majority").

**9.2. Mandatory Age Affirmation:**  
As a precondition to accessing or using the Platform, you will be required to affirmatively represent and warrant that you have reached the Age of Majority. This affirmation will be collected via a mandatory prompt, checkbox, or other mechanism presented to you on our Website or prior to downloading any Release or interacting with our services (e.g., minting a Digital Collectible). **By clicking "I Agree," "Confirm," or a similar affirmation, you are making a legally binding declaration that you meet this age requirement.** BETO.GROUP relies on the truthfulness of this declaration.

**9.3. No Use by Minors:**  
**IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF MAJORITY, YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM ACCESSING OR USING THE PLATFORM FOR ANY PURPOSE.** Do not proceed past any age affirmation gate, do not download any Releases, and do not provide any personal information to BETO.GROUP. Any use of the Platform by a minor is unauthorized, unlicensed, and in violation of these Terms.

**9.4. Verification and Termination for Underage Use:**  
While we do not currently implement identity verification, we do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under the Age of Majority. If BETO.GROUP becomes aware or has a reasonable belief that a user is a minor, we reserve the right to:  
(a) Immediately terminate that user's access to and use of the Platform without notice;  
(b) Delete any associated personal data in accordance with our Privacy Policy and applicable law (such as COPPA and GDPR); and  
(c) Take any other action deemed necessary by BETO.GROUP to enforce this policy.

**9.5. Compliance with Third-Party Age Requirements:**  
You acknowledge that to use certain aspects of the Platform, you may interact with Third-Party Offerings (such as the Obsidian Application, Discord, or NFT minting platforms). You are solely responsible for complying with all terms and conditions set forth by such third parties, including any age requirements they may stipulate, which may be different from our own.

## **10. Purchases and Payments for Digital Products**

This Section 10 governs any purchase you make of **digital products, content, or services offered for sale by BETO.GROUP** through the Platform or designated third-party platforms authorized by BETO.GROUP (each such item or service, when purchased, is referred to as a “Purchased Product”). Purchased Products may include, but are not limited to:  
(a) Specific Releases of BETO.GROUP’s Obsidian vaults;  
(b) Digital Collectibles (NFTs) offered for sale (distinct from NFTs that may be provided as incidental to other services or for access);  
(c) Digital art, templates, or other downloadable content packs; and  
(d) Access to specific online services, courses, or premium features, if offered for a fee.  
These terms are in addition to all other terms in this Agreement.

**10.1. Product Description and Availability**  
BETO.GROUP will make reasonable efforts to describe Purchased Products accurately. However, we do not warrant that product descriptions or other content are entirely accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. All purchases are subject to availability.

**10.2. Pricing**  
(a) All prices for Purchased Products will be as listed on the Platform or the authorized third-party sales platform at the time of your order.  
(b) Prices are quoted in **United States Dollars (USD)** unless expressly stated otherwise.  
(c) Prices are exclusive of any applicable sales taxes (such as state or local sales tax), Value Added Tax (VAT), Goods and Services Tax (GST), duties, or other governmental charges, which will be added to your total amount due at checkout, where applicable. You are responsible for paying all such taxes and charges based on your location and applicable law.  
(d) BETO.GROUP reserves the right to change prices for Purchased Products at any time without prior notice, but such changes will not affect orders already placed and confirmed.

**10.3. Orders and Payment**  
(a) To make a purchase, you may be required to provide certain information relevant to your transaction, including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your email address.  
(b) You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use any payment method(s) utilized in connection with any transaction.  
(c) By submitting such information, you grant to BETO.GROUP the right to provide such information to third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Ko-fi, Gumroad, or others as we may use) for purposes of facilitating the completion of transactions. You agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of any such third-party payment processor.  
(d) We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to: product availability, errors in the description or price of the product, error in your order, suspected fraud or unauthorized or illegal transaction, or other reasons.  
(e) Your order is an offer to buy. A contract between us for the purchase of a Purchased Product will be formed when we send you an order confirmation email or otherwise make the Purchased Product accessible to you after successful payment.

**10.4. Delivery of Digital Products**  
(a) Upon successful completion of your payment and order confirmation, Purchased Products will be delivered to you digitally.  
(b) Delivery may be made via a download link sent to the email address you provided, by granting you access to a specific area of the Platform, or through other digital means specified at the time of purchase (e.g., NFT airdrop to a provided wallet address if the NFT itself gates access to the content).  
(c) It is your responsibility to ensure that the email address and any other delivery information you provide are accurate and capable of receiving communications and deliveries from us. BETO.GROUP is not responsible for non-delivery due to incorrect information provided by you or issues with your email provider or systems.  
(d) Access to the Purchased Product is typically granted immediately or shortly after payment confirmation, but delays may occur. If your NFT is being delivered via Crossmint as part of the purchase process (as described in your welcome message), please allow up to seven (7) days for NFT processing and delivery which may gate access to the Purchased Product.

**10.5. REFUND POLICY FOR DIGITAL PRODUCTS**
**(a) General Policy: All Sales Are Final.**  
Due to the immediate, digital nature of the Purchased Products (such as downloadable software vaults and digital content) and the access provided upon purchase, **all sales of Purchased Products are generally considered final. BETO.GROUP typically does not offer refunds, returns, or exchanges once a purchase is completed and the Product has been delivered or made accessible.** We encourage you to carefully review all product descriptions, system requirements (if any), available previews or samples, and these Terms before making any purchase. If you have questions about a Purchased Product, please contact us at contact@beto.group before completing your transaction.
**(b) Exception for Mandatory Applicable Law (e.g., Faulty or Misdescribed Products):**  
Notwithstanding the general policy in Section 10.5(a), this policy does not override any **mandatory consumer protection rights applicable in your jurisdiction that cannot be waived by contract.** For example, in certain jurisdictions, you may have a statutory right to a refund or other remedy if a digital product is:  
(i) Significantly not as described on the Platform at the time of purchase;  
(ii) Faulty or not of satisfactory quality, preventing its intended use; or  
(iii) Not fit for a particular purpose that was expressly made known to BETO.GROUP before purchase and BETO.GROUP indicated the product was suitable for that purpose.
**(c) Process for Requesting a Refund Under Mandatory Applicable Law:**  
If you believe you are entitled to a refund or remedy under such mandatory applicable consumer protection laws in your jurisdiction, you must contact BETO.GROUP at legalis@beto.group within a reasonable time (and in any event, within any period prescribed by such applicable law, e.g., often 14 to 30 days from purchase or discovery of a fault). Your request must include:  
(i) Your order details (e.g., order number, date of purchase, email used).  
(ii) A clear explanation of why you believe the Purchased Product is faulty, significantly misdescribed, or otherwise qualifies for a refund under the mandatory laws of your jurisdiction, with specific details and, if possible, supporting evidence (e.g., screenshots).  
BETO.GROUP will review your request in good faith and in accordance with applicable law. If a refund or other remedy is deemed appropriate under such mandatory laws, BETO.GROUP will process it accordingly.
**(d) User Acknowledgment Regarding General Policy:**  
**By completing your purchase, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to our general policy of no refunds as stated in Section 10.5(a), subject only to your non-waivable statutory rights as described in Section 10.5(b). You agree that you are waiving any broader right to a refund or to cancel the purchase once delivery or access has commenced, except as provided by such mandatory, non-waivable laws.**
**(e) BETO.GROUP's Commitment to Accurate Descriptions:**  
BETO.GROUP is committed to providing accurate and clear descriptions of its Purchased Products to help you make informed decisions. If you believe a product description is inaccurate or misleading, please bring it to our attention at contact@beto.group even if you are not seeking a refund, so we may review and correct it if necessary.

**10.6. License Terms for Purchased Products**
(a) Your purchase of a Purchased Product grants you a license to use that specific Purchased Product in accordance with the terms set forth in Section 1 (Software Licensing Model) of this Agreement, and any other specific license terms that may accompany the Purchased Product.
(b) For the avoidance of doubt, any software Release offered as a Purchased Product is licensed to you exclusively and perpetually under the **MIT License**, as definitively established in Section 1.1 of these Terms. There are no time-based transitions to any other license.
(c) The purchase of a Purchased Product does not transfer any ownership rights in the intellectual property of the Purchased Product or any BETO.GROUP IP. You are purchasing a license to use the Purchased Product, not the underlying intellectual property itself.

**10.7. Cancellation Policy**  
As Purchased Products are digital and access is typically provided immediately upon or shortly after successful payment, orders cannot be cancelled once payment has been processed and delivery or access has commenced. If you wish to cancel an order before payment is completed, please do so through the payment interface if possible, or contact us immediately.

**10.8. User Responsibilities
You are responsible for:  
**(a) Ensuring you have the necessary software, specifically a compatible version of the Obsidian Application (Obsidian.md), and appropriate hardware to use the Purchased Product. BETO.GROUP provides vaults designed for the Obsidian Application; obtaining, licensing, and complying with the terms of the Obsidian Application itself is your separate responsibility.**  
(b) Maintaining the security of any download links or access credentials provided to you.  
(c) Backing up any data or customizations you make if you modify the Purchased Product.

## 11. Modification of Terms

BETO.GROUP reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, as determined in our reasonable discretion, we will provide at least thirty (30) days' prior notice before such new terms take effect.

**For the purposes of these Terms, "material changes" may include, but are not limited to, changes that:**  
**(a) Significantly alter your rights or obligations, such as modifications to the core Licensing Model (Section 1), the Give Back Mechanism (Section 2), or terms related to Digital Collectibles (Section 3);**  
**(b) Introduce new fees or significantly change existing fee structures (if any are implemented in the future);**  
**(c) Substantially limit your access to or use of significant features of the Platform;**  
**(d) Alter the disclaimers, limitations of liability, or indemnification provisions (e.g., Sections 5, 8.2(d)); or**  
**(e) Modify the Governing Law and Jurisdiction (Section 12) or the newly introduced Appeals Process (Section 8.4).**  
**Non-material changes, such as minor clarifications, typographical corrections, updates to contact information, or changes required by law that do not substantially affect your rights, may be made without the 30-day prior notice period, though the "Last Updated" date will be revised.**

Notification of any material changes will be provided to you primarily via email sent to the last email address you provided to BETO.GROUP (if any). **It is your sole responsibility to ensure that your email address on file with BETO.GROUP is current and accurate at all times to receive such notifications.** BETO.GROUP shall not be liable for your failure to receive notices if your email address is not current or is otherwise unable to receive emails from us. Additionally, or as a secondary method, we may also post a prominent notice on the Platform (e.g., a banner on the Website or a notification within the software).

Your continued access to or use of the Platform after the effective date of such modifications (i.e., after the conclusion of the 30-day notice period for material changes, or immediately upon posting for non-material changes) constitutes your conclusive acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by, the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, your sole recourse is to cease all access and use of the Platform prior to the effective date of the changes (for material changes) or immediately upon becoming aware of them (for non-material changes). It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically for changes, even if you have not received a direct notification due to an outdated email address or other delivery issues.

**12.1. Governing Law:**  
These Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them or their subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. BETO.GROUP is based in Alberta, Canada, and this choice of law provides a consistent legal framework.

**12.2. Informal Dispute Resolution (Mandatory First Step):**  
We encourage you to contact us first at legalis@beto.group to seek a resolution for any concerns or disputes arising from these Terms or your use of the Platform. Most user concerns can be resolved quickly and to the user's satisfaction by contacting our support. **Both parties agree to attempt to resolve any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through good faith negotiations for a period of at least thirty (30) days following written notification of the dispute to the other party. This informal resolution process shall be a precondition to either party initiating mediation, arbitration, or a lawsuit (except for matters qualifying for small claims court or urgent injunctive relief as outlined below).**

**12.3. Optional Mediation:**  
If a dispute cannot be resolved through the informal dispute resolution process described in Section 12.2, **the parties may, by mutual written agreement, attempt to settle the dispute by mediation before resorting to arbitration.** Mediation shall be administered by a mutually agreed-upon mediator or mediation service. If mediation is pursued, it may be conducted remotely (e.g., via video conference) to facilitate participation. Each party shall bear its own costs for mediation, and the parties shall share equally the mediator’s fees and expenses, unless otherwise agreed. Engaging in mediation is optional and does not waive either party's right to proceed to arbitration if mediation is unsuccessful or not pursued.

**12.4. Binding Arbitration (Primary Resolution for Disputes Not Resolved Amicably or by Mediation):**  
**(a) Agreement to Arbitrate:** If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution through informal dispute resolution (Section 12.2) **and do not mutually agree to or successfully resolve the dispute through mediation (Section 12.3)**, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the primary means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance, and breach), the parties' relationship with each other, and/or your use of the Platform shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by a recognized arbitration institution (e.g., the ADR Institute of Canada, or another mutually agreed-upon institution) in accordance with its commercial arbitration rules, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.  
**(b) Arbitrator and Rules:** The arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. The arbitrator, and not any federal, provincial, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be in writing and provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions, shall be binding on the parties, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.  
**(c) Location and Language:** The arbitration will be conducted in English. The seat of arbitration shall be Calgary, Alberta, Canada. However, for your convenience, if you are an individual consumer residing outside of Canada, the arbitration hearings may be conducted remotely (e.g., via video conference) or, if mutually agreed or ordered by the arbitrator for fairness, in your county or region of residence.  
**(d) Arbitration Fees:** The responsibility for payment of any arbitration filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the applicable arbitration rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed Ten Thousand USD ($10,000), BETO.GROUP will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose.  
**(e) Exception - Small Claims Court:** Notwithstanding the parties' agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction in Calgary, Alberta, or, if you are an individual consumer, in your local small claims court if permitted by that court's rules.  
**(f) Class Action Waiver:** **THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION (OR COURT PROCEEDING, WHERE APPLICABLE) SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES ONLY AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS.** If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration (or court proceeding) can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above in this Section 12.4 shall be deemed null and void in its entirety with respect to such class claim, and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate such class disputes (though individual claims may still be arbitrable).

**12.5. Exceptions to Arbitration and Jurisdiction for Certain Matters (Renumbered from 12.4):**  
**(a) Injunctive Relief and Intellectual Property:** Notwithstanding the foregoing dispute resolution procedures, BETO.GROUP may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect its intellectual property rights or confidential information, or to prevent or stop (or to address past or ongoing) unauthorized access or use of the Platform in violation of these Terms, in any court of competent jurisdiction, including the courts located in Calgary, Alberta.  
**(b) Consumer Rights in Local Jurisdiction (Limited and Conditional):** If you are an individual consumer (not a business entity) using the Platform for personal, family, or household purposes, **this local court option applies only where mandatory consumer protection laws in your jurisdiction of residence (i) grant you the right to bring claims in your local courts, AND (ii) expressly prohibit you from waiving such jurisdictional rights in a pre-dispute agreement like these Terms.** If both these conditions are met, then for disputes that qualify as consumer disputes under such laws and cannot be resolved by arbitration as set forth above (e.g., if your local law also prohibits pre-dispute arbitration agreements for such consumer claims or makes the class action waiver unenforceable for such claims), you may bring your claim in the courts of your jurisdiction of residence. However, for all other disputes, and for all business users, the terms of Section 12.4 (Binding Arbitration) and Section 12.6 (Exclusive Jurisdiction for Court Proceedings) shall apply.  
**(c) Governing Law Still Applies:** Even if a consumer dispute is heard in your local court under Section 12.5(b), the governing law as stated in Section 12.1 (Alberta law) shall still apply to the substance of the dispute, to the maximum extent permissible by your local mandatory consumer protection laws.

**12.6. Exclusive Jurisdiction for Court Proceedings (Not Subject to Arbitration or Permitted Local Consumer Courts - Renumbered from 12.5):**  
Except for matters properly brought in small claims court, consumer disputes eligible for local jurisdiction under Section 12.5(b), or for injunctive relief sought by BETO.GROUP under Section 12.5(a), you irrevocably agree that any legal action, suit, or proceeding arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Platform that is not subject to binding arbitration under Section 12.4, or for enforcement of an arbitration award, shall be brought exclusively in the courts located in the City of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, Canada ("Calgary Courts"). This specific location is chosen for its connection to BETO.GROUP's operational base and to ensure that legal matters are handled efficiently within this established legal system. You hereby irrevocably consent and submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such Calgary Courts for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.

**12.7. Acknowledgment by International Users (General - Renumbered from 12.6):**  
If you are accessing or using the Platform from a jurisdiction outside of Canada, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. You acknowledge and agree that by using the Platform and accepting these Terms, you are consenting to the dispute resolution mechanisms (including informal resolution, optional mediation, and binding arbitration) and jurisdictional provisions outlined herein, subject to any non-waivable mandatory consumer protection rights applicable in your country of residence. You acknowledge that resolving disputes even via remote processes or in Canadian courts may involve challenges and costs, and you willingly accept these as a condition of using the Platform.

**13.3. Binding Agreement:**

**Upon effective withdrawal of consent and/or account deletion:**  
**(i) Your right to access and use the Platform under these Terms will immediately cease.**  
**(ii) Certain obligations and rights will survive, as detailed in Section 8.3 (Survival). For instance, your obligations regarding software already downloaded will continue to be governed by the applicable licenses (MIT or GPLv3 as per Section 1), and any BETO.GROUP NFTs you own will remain your property on the blockchain, though Platform-dependent utility may cease as per Section 8.2(c).**  
**(iii) BETO.GROUP will process your data deletion request in accordance with our Privacy Policy and applicable law.**

(a) acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, or other natural disasters;
