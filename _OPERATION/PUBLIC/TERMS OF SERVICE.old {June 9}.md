Welcome to BETO.GROUP! These Terms of Service (“Terms”) constitute a legally binding agreement between you (“User,” “you,” or “your”) and BETO.GROUP ("BETO.GROUP," “we,” “us,” or “our”) governing your access to and use of the BETO.GROUP website (the "Website"), our software Releases, which are primarily delivered as downloadable vaults **designed for use with the Obsidian.md note-taking application (hereinafter "Obsidian Application")**, our Digital Collectibles (as defined below), and any related content, materials, or services (collectively, the “Platform”). **You acknowledge that the use of our vault Releases requires you to separately obtain and use the Obsidian Application, which is provided by a third party (Obsidian.md) and is subject to its own distinct terms of service and licensing conditions. BETO.GROUP is not affiliated with, nor endorsed by, the creators of the Obsidian Application beyond providing compatible content.**

BY ACCESSING OR USING ANY PART OF THE PLATFORM, OR BY CLICKING "I AGREE" (OR SIMILAR AFFIRMATION) WHERE SUCH OPTION IS MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS IN THEIR ENTIRETY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO ACCESS OR USE THE PLATFORM AND MUST IMMEDIATELY CEASE SUCH ACCESS AND USE.

## 1. Licensing Model

This Section outlines the licensing terms for all BETO.GROUP software "Releases." A "Release" is a distinct, packaged Obsidian vault (including all its content and tools) made available by BETO.GROUP, identifiable by its version (e.g., "July 2025 Release"). Our model offers users a choice: an initial period of permissive use under the MIT License, or the option to immediately adopt the GPLv3 license for any Release. This is designed to provide flexibility while encouraging ongoing engagement and contribution to the open-source community.

**1.1. Overview: Your Licensing Choices with BETO.GROUP Releases**  
When you obtain a BETO.GROUP Release, you have two primary licensing paths for your use of that specific Release:  
**(a) Standard Path (MIT First, then GPLv3):** By default, each Release is licensed to you under the flexible MIT License for an initial six-month period from its launch. After this period, that Release transitions to the GPLv3 license.  
**(b) Elective GPLv3 from Start Path:** Alternatively, you may choose to treat any BETO.GROUP Release as being licensed to you under the GPLv3 license from the moment you obtain it, forgoing the initial MIT License window entirely for that Release. (See Section 1.3).  
**(c) Maintaining MIT Flexibility for Your Derivative Works (Conditional on Standard Path):** If you obtain Releases under the Standard Path (MIT First), we offer a special condition – the "MIT Continuance" – allowing your own projects (Derivative Works) based on these Releases to remain under MIT-compatible terms, even for parts from older Releases, if you keep your project updated with our newest MIT-licensed Releases (i.e., those still in their Initial MIT Window under the Standard Path).

Understanding this model and the implications of your choice is key to using BETO.GROUP Releases effectively. We provide resources (see Section 1.8) to help you.

**1.2. Standard Path: Initial MIT License Window (First 6 Months)**  
**(a) Your Freedom with MIT:** If you choose to follow the Standard Path for a BETO.GROUP Release (i.e., you do not elect to treat it as GPLv3 from the start as per Section 1.3), it is licensed to you under the **<a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT License</a>**.  
**(b) Duration:** This MIT License applies for six (6) calendar months starting from the Release's official "Date of Availability" (this is its "Initial MIT Window").  
**(c) What You Can Do:** During this Initial MIT Window, the MIT License allows you to freely:
- Use and copy the Release.
- Modify it to fit your needs.
- Distribute your modified versions or incorporate the Release into your own projects (even commercially), as long as you include the original MIT copyright and permission notices.  
    **(d) Transition to GPLv3:** Once this six-month Initial MIT Window expires, that specific Release ("Transitioned Release"), if used or distributed on its own, automatically transitions to the **GNU General Public License v3 (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPLv3</a>)**. The GPLv3 is a "copyleft" license, meaning if you modify a Transitioned Release and distribute your modifications, you must license your entire modified version under the GPLv3 and make the source code of your modifications available.

**1.3. Elective GPLv3 from Start Path (User Choice)**  
**(a) Your Option for Immediate GPLv3:** For any BETO.GROUP Release you obtain, you have the option to elect to treat that Release as being licensed to you directly and immediately under the **GNU General Public License v3 (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPLv3</a>)** from its Date of Availability (or your date of acquisition).  
**(b) How to Elect:** Your decision to treat a Release as GPLv3 from the start is an internal choice you make regarding your use and any subsequent distribution of that Release. While no formal notification to BETO.GROUP is required for this election, your obligations under the GPLv3 will apply immediately to that Release if you choose this path. If you distribute or create derivative works from a Release you have elected to treat as GPLv3 from the start, you must comply with all GPLv3 terms from that point.  
**(c) No MIT Window for Elected Releases:** If you elect to treat a Release as GPLv3 from the start, that specific Release does not have an Initial MIT Window (as described in Section 1.2) for your use, and the automatic transition described in Section 1.2(d) is inapplicable because you have chosen for it to be GPLv3 from the outset.  
**(d) Implications for Use and Derivative Works:** By electing to treat a Release as GPLv3 from the start:  
* You receive all the rights and are subject to all the obligations of the GPLv3 for that Release immediately.  
* If you modify this Release and distribute your modifications, your entire modified version must be licensed under GPLv3, and you must make the source code of your modifications available.  
* This Release cannot be used to satisfy the MIT Continuance Condition (Section 1.4(a)(i)) for other components of a project that may have been obtained under the Standard Path (MIT First).

**1.4. The MIT Continuance Condition: Keeping Your Derivative Works MIT-Compatible (For Releases obtained and maintained under the Standard Path)**  
We understand you may want to build long-term projects ("Your Derivative Works") based on BETO.GROUP Releases (that you initially received and continue to treat under the Standard Path's MIT License terms) while maintaining the flexibility of the MIT License. "Your Derivative Works" are new projects or customized vaults you create that incorporate or are based on one or more BETO.GROUP Releases.  
**(a) How to Maintain MIT-Compatible Licensing for Your Derivative Work:** You can continue to license Your Derivative Work under MIT-compatible terms (e.g., the MIT License itself or another permissive license you choose for your original additions) IF AND ONLY IF:  
**(i) You Actively Integrate a "Current MIT Release":** Your Derivative Work must demonstrably include or be based on substantial components from at least one "Current MIT Release."  
* **Definition of "Current MIT Release":** A BETO.GROUP Release that you obtained under the Standard Path (Section 1.2), is still within its own six-month Initial MIT Window, and which you have not elected to treat as GPLv3 from the start (as per Section 1.3).  
**(ii) You Comply with MIT Terms:** You must always follow the original MIT License terms for any BETO.GROUP code in Your Derivative Work that you initially received under the MIT License as part of the Standard Path.  
**(b) Effect of Meeting the Condition:** If Your Derivative Work meets this MIT Continuance Condition, then for licensing purposes, all BETO.GROUP code within Your Derivative Work that was originally obtained under the Standard Path (even code from older Releases whose Initial MIT Windows have expired) is treated as if it remains under the MIT License within the context of Your Derivative Work. This special permission is granted by BETO.GROUP as the original copyright holder.  
**(c) What Happens if the Condition is No Longer Met:** If Your Derivative Work stops meeting the MIT Continuance Condition (e.g., you don't update it with a Current MIT Release, or all components have transitioned to GPLv3 or were elected by you as GPLv3 from start):  
**(i) Older Standard Path Code Reverts:** Any BETO.GROUP code in Your Derivative Work from Releases whose Initial MIT Windows have expired (and were obtained under the Standard Path) will then be fully governed by the GPLv3.  
**(ii) Your Entire Derivative Work Becomes Subject to GPLv3:** If Your Derivative Work now contains any GPLv3-governed code (either through transition from the Standard Path, or by your election under Section 1.3), Your entire Derivative Work must comply with the GPLv3 if you distribute or further modify it.

**1.5. Practical Implications and Examples**  
**(a) Using a Single Release (Standard Path):** If you download the "July 2025 Release" and follow the Standard Path, you have MIT freedom until its Initial MIT Window ends (six months after its Date of Availability). After that, if you modify and distribute just that July 2025 Release, it must be under GPLv3.  
**(b) Using a Single Release (Elective GPLv3 from Start Path):** If you download the "July 2025 Release" and elect to treat it as GPLv3 from the start, it is under GPLv3 for you immediately. If you modify and distribute it at any time, it must be under GPLv3.  
**(c) Building a Long-Term Project (Your Derivative Work, using Standard Path components for MIT Continuance):**
- You start "My Custom Vault" in July 2025 using the "July 2025 Release" (obtained and treated under Standard Path/MIT).
- In January 2026, the "July 2025 Release" component in your vault would normally become GPLv3.
- However, if in December 2025 you integrated parts of BETO.GROUP's "December 2025 Release" (which is a Current MIT Release, obtained and treated by you under its Standard Path/MIT terms) into "My Custom Vault," then "My Custom Vault" (including the July parts) can remain MIT-compatible.
- If you don't integrate a Current MIT Release by the time the July components would transition, and you later distribute "My Custom Vault," it must be GPLv3.  
    **(d) Combining Releases with Different Licensing Choices in a Derivative Work:**
- You create "My Combined Vault." You incorporate the "July 2025 Release" (obtained and treated under Standard Path/MIT). You also incorporate the "August 2025 Release," for which you elect to treat it as GPLv3 from the start.
- The "August 2025 Release" component is GPLv3 from the moment you made that election for your use.
- If you distribute "My Combined Vault," it must be licensed under GPLv3 due to the inclusion of the "August 2025 Release" (your elected GPLv3 component), regardless of the status of the "July 2025 Release" or any MIT Continuance attempts for the July part.

**1.6. Your Responsibilities as a User:**  
Successfully navigating this licensing model requires your attention:  
**(a) Understand Your Licensing Choice for Each Release:** For each Release you obtain, be clear whether you are following the Standard Path (MIT first) or electing to treat it as GPLv3 from the start. This choice dictates your immediate obligations.  
**(b) Track Release Windows (for Standard Path):** If you use Releases under the Standard Path, be aware of the Date of Availability and the six-month Initial MIT Window for each.  
**(c) Maintain Updates (for MIT Continuance on Standard Path components):** If you want Your Derivative Work (containing Standard Path components) to stay MIT-compatible under the MIT Continuance Condition, you must actively incorporate Current MIT Releases from BETO.GROUP (which themselves must be under their Standard Path MIT window).  
**(d) Understand GPLv3 Obligations:** Whether a Release transitions to GPLv3 after its MIT Window (Standard Path), or you elect for it to be GPLv3 from the start, be prepared to comply with GPLv3 for Your Derivative Works containing such code if you distribute them.  
**(e) Accidental Violations:** The risk of unintentionally violating GPLv3 terms is higher if your choice for each Release and its implications (or tracking for Standard Path) is not diligent. We aim to provide tools to minimize this (see Section 1.8).

**1.7. BETO.GROUP's Commitment to Clarity & Support**  
To help you manage these terms, BETO.GROUP will strive to provide:  
**(a) Clear Release Information and Embedded Guidance:** Each Release will have its Date of Availability clearly stated (e.g., on the download page and within a [[CHANGE LOG]] file inside the Release). This [[CHANGE LOG]] file will also state the expiration date of its Initial MIT Window (applicable if you follow the Standard Path for that Release). Furthermore, each Release will endeavor to include embedded within it a **[[FAQ.classic|FAQ]]** and a **[[LICENSE GUIDE]]** note, providing direct access to detailed explanations of this licensing model.  
**(b) Website Licensing Resources:** We will also maintain a comprehensive Licensing FAQ and/or Licensing Guide on our Website. These resources will explain this model (including the Standard Path with its MIT-to-GPLv3 transition, and the User-Elective GPLv3 from Start Path), your obligations, the MIT Continuance Condition, and provide a table of Release dates and license transition points (for the Standard Path). The content of the website resources will generally mirror or expand upon the information found in the embedded **[[FAQ.classic|FAQ]]** and **[[LICENSE GUIDE]]** notes within the Releases.  
**(c) Tools for Checking (Planned):** We aim to develop and provide simple tools or scripts to help you check if Your Derivative Work currently meets the MIT Continuance Condition (for Standard Path components) by identifying if it incorporates a Current MIT Release.  
**(d) No Individual Notifications:** While we provide these resources, BETO.GROUP cannot offer individualized license tracking or reminders. The ultimate responsibility for compliance rests with you and your chosen licensing path for each Release.  
**(e) Future Changes to This Model:** This licensing model, particularly the MIT Continuance Condition and the User-Elective GPLv3 from Start Path, is offered at BETO.GROUP's discretion. Any changes will be made according to Section 11 (Modification of Terms) and will apply prospectively.

**1.8. Disclaimer:**  
This licensing model is unique. While BETO.GROUP grants these permissions as the copyright holder, ensure you understand the terms and your choices fully. If you have complex distribution plans for Your Derivative Works, consulting with a legal professional familiar with open-source licensing is always advisable.

## 2. Give Back Mechanism

**2.0. Our Philosophy and Commitment: Leading by Example**  
BETO.GROUP thrives on the principles of open creation, shared knowledge, and community support. We believe that when significant commercial value is derived from collectively built resources, a portion of that success should flow back to nourish the ecosystem.  
**As such, BETO.GROUP is committed to acting as a role model. We pledge to allocate a comparable portion of our own relevant net revenue or operational resources (derived from activities related to the Platform) towards supporting open-source projects, creative commons initiatives, or community endeavors aligned with the spirit of this Section, once BETO.GROUP itself meets comparable financial milestones or achieves sustainable operation.** Our contributions will be publicly documented (see Section 2.5). This initiative underscores our belief in reciprocal support.

**2.1. The Give Back Expectation: Purpose and Scope**  
The **purpose of this Give Back Mechanism** is to foster and sustain the broader ecosystem of open-source development, creative exploration, and initiatives promoting self-understanding, in alignment with BETO.GROUP's core mission.  
This Section applies if you utilize BETO.GROUP’s Platform (defined as our software Releases, vaults, tools, and directly provided resources, excluding general concepts or ideas discussed in public community forums unless such concepts are uniquely embodied in our Platform resources) in connection with your **for-profit commercial activities**.  
When the success thresholds (Section 2.2) are met, there is a strong expectation that you will engage with this Give Back Mechanism in good faith. **While specific contributions are voluntary and not a condition for general use of the Platform's core software or NFT ownership, your good-faith engagement in the dialogue outlined in Section 2.6 upon meeting Success Thresholds is expected to uphold our community ethos.**

**2.2. Triggering Conditions for the Give Back Expectation:**  
A contribution back to the creative community ("Contribution") is expected if your for-profit commercial activities meet EITHER of the following "Success Thresholds" in an annual reporting period:  
**(a) Net Revenue:** The **annual net revenue** derived specifically from products, services, or activities that directly incorporate or demonstrably and substantially rely upon core components or significant functionalities of BETO.GROUP's Platform resources equals or exceeds **One Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (USD $100,000.00)**.  
* **Guidance on "Substantially Rely On":** This refers to situations where BETO.GROUP's resources form a foundational or indispensable part of your qualifying product/service, significantly diminishing its value or requiring substantial independent development otherwise. Incidental use is not the primary focus. Dialogue is encouraged for clarification (Section 2.6).  
**(b) Gross Revenue:** The **annual gross revenue** derived from such specific products, services, or activities described in 2.2(a) equals or exceeds **One Million United States Dollars (USD $1,000,000.00)**.

**2.3. Nature, Scale, and Focus of Expected Contributions:**  
**(a) Focus Areas:** Contributions should primarily support: open-source projects, non-profits fostering creativity/learning, or your own release of open-licensed resources benefiting these areas.  
**(b) Flexibility in Form:** Contributions can be monetary, open work, or pro-bono services/mentorship.  
**(c) Principle of Meaningful and Proportionate Contribution:** Contributions should be **meaningful** and in **reasonable proportion** to the revenue derived from BETO.GROUP's resources.  
**(i) Monetary Guideline:** Approximately **0.55% to 1.11% of the qualifying net revenue** (or a proportionally smaller percentage of gross revenue) is a guideline for an appropriate financial contribution.  
**(ii) Non-Monetary Guideline:** Non-monetary contributions should aim for reasonably equivalent value/impact.  
**These are guidelines to inform a good-faith effort. The emphasis is on genuine contribution that results from the dialogue process (see Section 2.6).**

**2.4. Rewards and Recognition for Contributors:**  
BETO.GROUP highly values users and entities who actively participate in this Give Back Mechanism. **We plan to offer various forms of recognition and potential rewards to those who make meaningful contributions and transparently share their efforts.** This may include, but is not limited to:  
(a) Public acknowledgment on the BETO.GROUP website or community platforms (with your permission).  
(b) Special badges, roles, or designations within the BETO.GROUP community.  
(c) Early access to new BETO.GROUP Releases or features.  
(d) Discounts on future paid products or services from BETO.GROUP.  
(e) Opportunities for collaboration or featured showcases.  
Details of any formal rewards program will be announced separately.

**2.5. Documenting and Publicly Disclosing Contributions:**  
If you choose to make a Contribution following the dialogue process, you are strongly encouraged to publicly disclose it annually in a clear, specific, easily accessible, verifiable, and timely manner. This demonstrates transparency and inspires others. Optional notification to BETO.GROUP at legalis@beto.group with a link to your disclosure is appreciated and may facilitate recognition.

**2.6. Mandatory Good Faith Discussion (Upon Meeting Thresholds):**  
**(a) User's Obligation to Initiate Discussion:** If you meet the Success Thresholds (Section 2.2), you are **required to initiate a good faith discussion with BETO.GROUP by contacting legalis@beto.group within sixty (60) days** of the end of your annual reporting period in which the threshold was met. The purpose of this discussion is to:  
(i) Acknowledge your use of BETO.GROUP resources and the meeting of a Success Threshold.  
(ii) Discuss your plans for making a meaningful and proportionate Contribution, explore suitable forms of contribution, or explain any circumstances that might affect your ability or approach to contributing at that time.  
**(b) BETO.GROUP's Commitment to Reasonable Discussion:** BETO.GROUP commits to engaging in these discussions reasonably, collaboratively, and with an understanding of diverse business situations. Our primary aim is to find a mutually agreeable path towards fulfilling the spirit of this Give Back Mechanism. We are open to discussing alternative forms, scales, or timelines for contribution if well-justified. **The obligation under this Section 2.6 is to engage in this discussion seriously and in good faith, not a pre-commitment to a specific payment amount before such discussion.**  
**(c) Pre-emptive Dialogue Encouraged:** We strongly encourage you to contact us proactively even before meeting the thresholds if you anticipate doing so, or if you need clarification on "substantially rely on" or "meaningful contribution."

**2.7. Compliance and Consequences:**  
**(a) Focus on Engagement and Good Faith Effort:** BETO.GROUP's primary measure of compliance with this Section 2 will be your fulfillment of the obligation to initiate and participate in the mandatory good faith discussion (Section 2.6(a)) upon meeting the Success Thresholds, and thereafter making a reasonable, good-faith effort towards a mutually understood contribution (or an alternative outcome agreed upon during the discussion) that is then, ideally, publicly disclosed.  
**(b) Consequences of Failure to Engage or Bad Faith in Discussion:** **Failure to initiate the required good faith discussion as per Section 2.6(a) after meeting a Success Threshold, or a clear demonstration of bad faith during such discussions (e.g., outright refusal to discuss any form of contribution or reciprocity without reasonable justification after benefiting substantially), shall constitute a material breach of these Terms.** This may result in:  
(i) Termination of your access to the Platform (as per Section 8).  
(ii) Ineligibility for any rewards, recognition, or discretionary benefits offered by BETO.GROUP.  
**(c) Disagreements on Contribution Post-Discussion:** If, after a completed good faith discussion, there remains a significant disagreement solely on the adequacy or specific form of a disclosed contribution (provided a genuine effort was made and the discussion obligation was fulfilled), BETO.GROUP will generally not treat this as a material breach leading to immediate termination, but reserves the right to:  
(i) Note the outcome of the discussion or the nature of the contribution (or lack thereof, if applicable post-discussion) publicly if deemed necessary for community transparency, particularly if no mutually agreeable path was found despite good faith efforts from BETO.GROUP.  
(ii) Reconsider eligibility for future discretionary benefits, new commercial licenses, or specific partnership opportunities offered by BETO.GROUP.  
Legal action to enforce a specific monetary contribution would be an extreme last resort, considered only in cases of clear, substantial, ongoing commercial exploitation coupled with a demonstrable refusal to engage in the mandatory good faith discussion or a clear showing of bad faith throughout the process.

## 3. Digital Collectibles (NFTs), Utility, and Associated Rights

BETO.GROUP may offer or utilize Non-Fungible Tokens (“NFTs” or "Digital Collectibles") as part of its Platform. These are unique digital assets recorded on blockchain networks such as Avalanche, Polygon, or others as specified by BETO.GROUP ("Applicable Blockchain Network").

**This section outlines your ownership of BETO.GROUP NFTs, the utilities they may provide, and the rights you have to any art or content specifically associated with them.** By acquiring or using a BETO.GROUP NFT, you agree to these terms.

**3.1. NFT Ownership and Blockchain Nature**  
**(a) What You Own:** When you lawfully acquire a BETO.GROUP NFT—whether directly from us, through a designated third-party platform like Crossmint, or on a secondary market—you own the cryptographic token itself. Your ownership is recorded on the Applicable Blockchain Network and managed by the governing Smart Contract (the self-executing code for the NFT).  
**(b) Our Limitations:** BETO.GROUP has no ability to seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any BETO.GROUP NFT once it's recorded on the blockchain and your transaction is confirmed.  
**(c) Your Responsibilities:** You are solely responsible for:  
(i) The security and management of your own private blockchain wallets (including private keys or seed phrases).  
(ii) Validating all transactions and contracts before approval.  
(iii) Understanding and complying with the terms, privacy policies, and any fees (including gas or platform fees) of third-party platforms (like Crossmint) if you use them to acquire NFTs. These are separate from our Terms.  
**(d) Irreversible Transactions:** Blockchain transactions are generally irreversible. BETO.GROUP cannot undo, reverse, or restore any transactions.  
**(e) No Financial Investment Value:** BETO.GROUP NFTs are intended as digital collectibles and utility tokens for our ecosystem. We make no guarantees about their future financial value or market liquidity. Any price paid is for the NFT and its described Utility/Art, not as an investment.

**3.2. Utility and Access Rights**  
**(a) Nature of Utility:** Each BETO.GROUP NFT is primarily intended to provide "Utility," which may include granting access to specific experiences, Platform features, exclusive content, community roles, or other benefits as described by BETO.GROUP at the time of the NFT's offering or in its metadata.  
**(b) Examples of Utility:** This may include, but is not limited to: access to exclusive channels on our community platforms (e.g., Discord), early access to new software Releases, gated content or tools, eligibility for future airdrops, or governance participation if implemented.  
**(c) Platform Dependence:** Many Utilities, especially those requiring interaction with BETO.GROUP-controlled systems ("Platform-dependent Utility"), depend on your continued authorized access to and good standing on the BETO.GROUP Platform. Termination of your Platform access may impact your ability to realize such Utilities. **For example, if your general Platform access is terminated, you might lose any special Discord server roles, early access privileges to new software Releases, or access to exclusive website content that was tied to your NFT ownership via Platform verification.** (A more detailed explanation and further examples are provided in Section 8.2(c)).

**3.3. License to Associated Art/Content (Not Ownership of IP)**  
**It is crucial to understand that your ownership of a BETO.GROUP NFT grants you ownership of the specific digital token recorded on the Applicable Blockchain Network and the specific license rights to any Associated Art/Content as detailed below. It does not grant you ownership of the underlying intellectual property (e.g., copyright, trademarks) in the Associated Art/Content or any other BETO.GROUP IP, all of which are retained by BETO.GROUP (or its licensors) as further detailed in Section 3.4.**

If a BETO.GROUP NFT has digital artwork or creative content specifically created by BETO.GROUP and linked to it ("Associated Art/Content"), the following license terms apply to the lawful holder of that NFT, subject to your continued compliance with these Terms:  
**(a) Personal Use License:** You are granted a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, copy, and display the Associated Art/Content for your personal, non-commercial enjoyment.  
**(b) Broad Commercial Use License:** You are also granted an unlimited, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the Associated Art/Content to create derivative works for "Commercial Use." This includes, for example, producing and selling merchandise (like T-shirts or prints) displaying the Associated Art/Content or incorporating it into your own digital or physical projects.  
**(c) Clarifications on Commercial Use:** This Commercial Use license allows you to:  
(i) Own or operate a marketplace for BETO.GROUP NFTs, provided it cryptographically verifies ownership for displaying Associated Art/Content.  
(ii) Own or operate a third-party website/application that includes BETO.GROUP NFTs, provided it cryptographically verifies ownership for displaying Associated Art/Content and removes the display if you leave the site/application.  
(iii) Earn revenue from the above activities.  
**(d) Restrictions on Use:** You agree not to use any Associated Art/Content in connection with media depicting hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, illegal activities, or anything constituting hate speech, infringing on others' rights, or likely to bring BETO.GROUP or its community into disrepute.  
**(e) Display on Marketplaces/Third-Party Sites:** You may display the Associated Art/Content on platforms that permit NFT sales or inclusion, provided they cryptographically verify ownership.

**3.4. Intellectual Property Ownership (BETO.GROUP IP) 
You acknowledge that BETO.GROUP (or its licensors) owns all legal right, title, and interest in and to any Associated Art/Content, and all intellectual property rights therein (e.g., copyright, trademarks), as well as in the BETO.GROUP name, logos, and other branding, **and all original content, templates, structures, and methodologies provided within BETO.GROUP software Releases** ("BETO.GROUP IP"). Your rights to Associated Art/Content are strictly limited to the licenses expressly granted in Section 3.3. All other rights are reserved by BETO.GROUP. Your use of BETO.GROUP IP (beyond the licensed display of Associated Art/Content) requires our express permission and adherence to our branding guidelines. Please also refer to Section 5.6 regarding our policies on unintentional infringement and the procedure for alleged copyright infringement concerning Platform assets, including Associated Art/Content.

**3.5. Key Risks and Disclaimers Specific to NFTs**  
Your use of BETO.GROUP NFTs involves inherent risks. Please understand that:  
**(a) "AS IS" Provision:** NFTs, Smart Contracts, associated utilities, and any third-party minting/distribution platforms (like Crossmint) are provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE," without warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, utility, or non-infringement.  
**(b) Blockchain Technology Risks:** You risk hardware/software/internet failures, malware, smart contract vulnerabilities, and unauthorized wallet access. BETO.GROUP is not responsible for blockchain network failures, errors, or delays, nor for losses from user error (e.g., lost passwords), smart contract issues, or third-party attacks.  
**(c) Regulatory Uncertainty & Changes in Law:** The legal and regulatory landscape for digital assets is evolving and uncertain. **BETO.GROUP is not liable for any loss, damage, or inability to use or realize the Utility or value of your NFTs due to changes in applicable laws, regulations, or policies that may impact their use, transferability, legality, or value after your acquisition.**  
**(d) No Financial Advice:** Information from BETO.GROUP about NFTs is not financial advice.  
**(e) Third-Party Platform Reliance:** Minting, distribution, or trading may rely on third-party platforms (e.g., Crossmint, OpenSea). BETO.GROUP is not responsible for these platforms' operations, security, or policies.

* **Third-Party Data Practices:** Our full Privacy Policy also details how third-party services linked from or integrated with our Platform (e.g., social media, Crossmint) may collect and process your data under their own distinct policies.

The full Privacy Policy provides comprehensive information on all these aspects and more. Your agreement to these Terms also signifies your acknowledgment and acceptance of our Privacy Policy.

**4.2. Third-Party Links and Services**  
The Platform may contain links to, or integrate with, third-party websites, services, content, applications, or tools (e.g., embedded iframes; links to social media platforms such as Discord, YouTube, GitHub, Ko-fi; payment processors; NFT minting/delivery services like Crossmint; **and integrated third-party software functionalities or plugins for the Obsidian Application such as the Excalidraw plugin, Dataview plugin, Datacore plugin, or other community plugins**) that are not owned or controlled by BETO.GROUP.
**(a) No Endorsement or Responsibility for Third-Party Offerings:** BETO.GROUP does not endorse, warrant, or assume any responsibility for any such third-party sites, information, materials, products, services, or tools (collectively, "Third-Party Offerings"). Your access to and use of any Third-Party Offering, including any sharing of your content or data with such Third-Party Offerings, is entirely at your own risk. **Specifically, for integrated tools or plugins for the Obsidian Application (such as, but not limited to, Excalidraw, Dataview, or Datacore) that may be utilized within, recommended by, or compatible with our Platform resources, these are provided by third parties. Such Third-Party Offerings operate under their own distinct terms of service, licenses (which may, for example, grant you ownership of content you create with them, like drawings made in Excalidraw, or provide software under licenses like the MIT License), and privacy policies. BETO.GROUP is not responsible for the functionality, security, licensing, data practices, or any other aspect of these Third-Party Offerings.**
**(b) Separate Terms and Policies Govern Third-Party Offerings:** You expressly acknowledge and agree that BETO.GROUP is not liable for any loss, damage, or other issues arising from your use of any Third-Party Offering. Your interactions with such third parties and your use of their Offerings, including any terms, conditions, warranties, or representations associated with such dealings (such as their licensing terms for software or for content you create with their tools, their fee structures, or their privacy policies), are solely between you and the respective third party.
**(c) User Diligence Required:** We strongly encourage you to be aware when you are interacting with a Third-Party Offering (even if accessed or facilitated through our Platform) and to diligently read the terms and conditions, licenses, and privacy policy of each Third-Party Offering that you visit, utilize, or whose tools you employ. While BETO.GROUP may design its Platform resources to be compatible with or to leverage certain Third-Party Offerings (like specific Obsidian plugins) for an enhanced user experience, you are responsible for understanding and complying with the terms applicable to those Third-Party Offerings directly from their providers. If you install or use such Third-Party Offerings, you do so at your own discretion and risk. Further details regarding specific third-party services that may collect data through our Platform are also outlined in our Privacy Policy (see Section 4 of the Privacy Policy).

**5.2. "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE":**  
THE PLATFORM, INCLUDING ALL SOFTWARE (RELEASES AND ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), CONTENT, MATERIALS, AND DIGITAL COLLECTIBLES (NFTS) PROVIDED BY BETO.GROUP, IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

BETO.GROUP MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE PLATFORM WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE PLATFORM OR THE SERVERS THAT MAKE IT AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM BETO.GROUP OR THROUGH THE PLATFORM SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN.

**5.4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:**  
**(a) Exclusion of Indirect Damages:** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL BETO.GROUP, ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE PLATFORM OR ANY CONTENT OR SERVICES THEREIN.  
**(b) Aggregate Liability Cap:** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BETO.GROUP’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS, LOSSES, DAMAGES, OR EXPENSES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM, THESE TERMS, OR ANY PURCHASED PRODUCT (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 10), WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL BE STRICTLY LIMITED. **OUR LIABILITY TO YOU IS CAPPED AT EIGHTY-EIGHT UNITED STATES DOLLARS AND EIGHTY-EIGHT CENTS (USD $88.88).**
**IF, AND ONLY IF, THE FOREGOING LIMITATION (USD $88.88) IS FOUND BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO BE UNENFORCEABLE OR UNREASONABLE UNDER THE SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOUR CLAIM, THEN IN SUCH SPECIFIC INSTANCE ONLY, BETO.GROUP'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR THAT CLAIM SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO BETO.GROUP SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PURCHASED PRODUCT(S) (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 10) THAT ARE THE DIRECT SUBJECT OF, AND INEXTRICABLY TIED TO, YOUR CLAIM, AND WHICH WERE PAID WITHIN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM.**
**IF, AND ONLY IF, THE FOREGOING LIMITATION (USD $88.88) IS FOUND BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO BE UNENFORCEABLE OR UNREASONABLE UNDER THE SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOUR CLAIM, THEN IN SUCH SPECIFIC INSTANCE ONLY, BETO.GROUP'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR THAT CLAIM SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO BETO.GROUP SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PURCHASED PRODUCT(S) (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 10) THAT ARE THE DIRECT SUBJECT OF, AND INEXTRICABLY TIED TO, YOUR CLAIM, AND WHICH WERE PAID WITHIN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM.**
If no such specific, identifiable payments were made by you for a Purchased Product directly and inextricably tied to your claim within that twelve-month period, or if your claim does not relate to a Purchased Product for which payment was made, then the primary limitation of USD $88.88 shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by law.
For the avoidance of doubt, these limitations are cumulative (not per incident) and represent the absolute maximum aggregate liability of BETO.GROUP under any and all circumstances.
**(c) Jurisdictional Limitations:** SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE PLATFORM OR WITH THESE TERMS, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THE PLATFORM.

**5.5. Indemnification by User**  
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless BETO.GROUP and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, and licensors (collectively, the "BETO.GROUP Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all third-party claims, demands, actions, suits, proceedings, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) (collectively, "Claims") arising out of or in any way connected with:
**(a) Your Breach of These Terms:** Your breach or alleged breach of any of your representations, warranties, covenants, or obligations under these Terms;
**(b) Your Misuse of the Platform:** Your access to or use of the Platform in a manner that violates these Terms or any applicable law, rule, or regulation;
**(c) Your Content or Submissions (if applicable):** Any content, data, or materials you submit, post, transmit, or otherwise make available through the Platform (if such features are offered) that infringes upon the rights of any third party or violates any law;
**(d) Your Violation of Rights or Laws:** Your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property, or privacy right, or your violation of any applicable laws, rules, or regulations; or
**(e) Your Negligence or Willful Misconduct:** Any gross negligence or willful misconduct on your part.

**Exclusion:** Notwithstanding the foregoing, your indemnification obligations under this Section 5.5 shall not extend to any Claims to the extent that such Claims are proven to have arisen primarily and directly from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of BETO.GROUP or its Indemnified Parties.

BETO.GROUP reserves the right, at its own expense (subject to your indemnification obligation for other costs if the claim falls within your responsibility), to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate fully with BETO.GROUP in asserting any available defenses. You agree not to settle any matter for which you have an indemnification obligation without the prior written consent of BETO.GROUP.

**5.6. Intellectual Property Rights in Platform Assets (including NFT Associated Art/Content) and Procedure for Alleged Copyright Infringement**  
**(a) Creation of Assets:** BETO.GROUP endeavors to create original visual assets for the Platform. This includes, but is not limited to, visuals within any "Assets Library," those provided as part of downloadable software Releases, and **any "Associated Art/Content" linked to BETO.GROUP Digital Collectibles (NFTs) as defined in Section 3.1.** The creative process for some assets involves the interpretation, re-drawing, or transformative adaptation of existing concepts or publicly available materials, utilizing digital creation tools (such as Excalidraw), with the goal of producing new, distinct expressions. BETO.GROUP offers these assets in good faith, under the belief that they constitute original creations or fall within the scope of permissible transformative use.  
**(b) No Warranty Against Unintentional Infringement:** Despite our efforts, due to the nature of creative inspiration and the vast amount of existing visual material, BETO.GROUP cannot and does not warrant that all visual assets provided on the Platform, **including Associated Art/Content for NFTs,** are entirely free from any unintentional resemblance to, or infringement upon, third-party copyrighted works or other intellectual property rights.  
**(c) Notice and Takedown Procedure for Alleged Copyright Infringement:** BETO.GROUP respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any content or asset available on the Platform, **including any Associated Art/Content for a BETO.GROUP NFT,** infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the following procedure. Please provide our designated Copyright Agent ([legalis@beto.group](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=mailto%3Alegalis%40beto.group)) with the following information in writing (a "Notice of Alleged Infringement"):  
(i) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  
(ii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works.  
(iii) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit BETO.GROUP to locate the material (e.g., a URL to the page, a clear description of where the asset can be found within a specific Release, **or the name/ID of the specific NFT and a description of its Associated Art/Content**).  
(iv) Information reasonably sufficient to permit BETO.GROUP to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address.  
(v) A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.  
(vi) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  
**(d) BETO.GROUP's Response to Notices:** Upon receipt of a compliant Notice of Alleged Infringement, BETO.GROUP will:  
(i) Expeditiously investigate the claim.  
(ii) If BETO.GROUP determines in its reasonable discretion that an infringement may have occurred, it will remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material from the Platform. **If the allegedly infringing material is Associated Art/Content for an NFT, BETO.GROUP may also take steps to disassociate or update the metadata for that NFT on platforms it controls to reflect the removal or change, where technically feasible, and may publicly note the status of the contested art.**  
(iii) BETO.GROUP may, at its discretion, notify the user who provided or is associated with the allegedly infringing material (if applicable and identifiable) or the current holder of an NFT whose Associated Art/Content is contested, and provide them with an opportunity to submit a counter-notification if they believe the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification.  
(iv) BETO.GROUP reserves the right to terminate access for users who are found to be repeat infringers, or to take action against NFTs whose Associated Art/Content is repeatedly found to be infringing, in appropriate circumstances.  
**(e) Limitation of Liability for Unintentional Infringement:** To the maximum extent permitted by law, BETO.GROUP shall not be liable for any direct or indirect damages arising from any unintentional infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by assets provided on the Platform, **including Associated Art/Content for NFTs.** Our sole obligation in such an event, upon receipt of a valid Notice of Alleged Infringement, will be to investigate and, if deemed appropriate, take action regarding the contested material as described above.  
**(f) User Responsibility:** If you use assets from the Platform, **including Associated Art/Content from BETO.GROUP NFTs,** in your own projects, derivative works, or for commercial purposes (as permitted under Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for ensuring that your specific use of those assets complies with all applicable laws and does not infringe upon any third-party rights. Your license to use Associated Art/Content (as per Section 3.3) is granted subject to the condition that such use is lawful and non-infringing.

## 6. Feedback

**6.1. Submission of Feedback:**  
BETO.GROUP welcomes and encourages your feedback, comments, ideas, suggestions, improvements, or materials you submit concerning the Platform (collectively, “Feedback”). You may submit Feedback through various channels, including but not limited to:  
**(a) Email:** Directly to contact@beto.group.  
**(b) Community Channels:** Through official BETO.GROUP community platforms (e.g., Discord server, designated forums), as guided by those platforms’ rules.  
We particularly value Feedback in the form of bug reports, clear feature ideas, usability suggestions, or community-driven initiatives that align with BETO.GROUP's mission.

**6.2. Nature of Feedback and License to BETO.GROUP:**  
You acknowledge and agree that all Feedback you provide will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary to you. By submitting Feedback, you hereby grant BETO.GROUP a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, non-exclusive, transferable, and fully sublicensable right and license to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, create derivative works from, integrate into its Platform, transmit, distribute, and otherwise exploit such Feedback in any manner and for any purpose, including for commercial purposes, without compensation, attribution, or restriction to you. This license grant allows BETO.GROUP to freely incorporate and act upon your Feedback to improve or develop its Platform and services.

**6.3. User's Retention of Ownership in Underlying Ideas:**  
The license granted to BETO.GROUP in Section 6.2 pertains to the Feedback as submitted by you. To the extent that your Feedback contains original ideas, concepts, or inventions in which you hold pre-existing intellectual property rights (such as patentable inventions or original copyrighted works that exist independently of the Feedback submitted), you retain ownership of such underlying pre-existing intellectual property rights. However, your submission of Feedback grants BETO.GROUP the broad license described above to use the Feedback itself, including any suggestions or expressions of those ideas, as part of our development and improvement processes. BETO.GROUP’s use of your Feedback under the granted license does not, in itself, transfer ownership of your separately protected, pre-existing intellectual property to BETO.GROUP, unless a separate written agreement (such as an IP assignment agreement) is entered into.

**6.4. No Obligation to Use:**  
BETO.GROUP is under no obligation to use, implement, or act upon any Feedback it receives. The decision to do so is at BETO.GROUP’s sole discretion.

**6.5. Rewards for Feedback:**  
BETO.GROUP may, at its sole discretion, offer rewards, recognition, or compensation for Feedback it deems exceptionally valuable or for significant contributions ("big-picture ideas"). Any such rewards or compensation shall be subject to a separate written agreement between you and BETO.GROUP, if applicable.

(c) **Intellectual Property Infringement:** Uploading, posting, sharing, or distributing content that violates or infringes upon the copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights of any party **(e.g., including commercially licensed themes or plugins within a shared vault without the necessary rights, or using BETO.GROUP’s logo on your own derivative work in a way that implies official endorsement)**; using BETO.GROUP IP (as defined in Section 3.4) without express permission or in a manner not authorized by these Terms or applicable law; falsely claiming authorship of, or endorsement by, BETO.GROUP for content or modifications you create or distribute.  
(d) **Harassment and Harmful Behavior:** Harassing, threatening, bullying, stalking, or intimidating others; posting or transmitting defamatory, libelous, obscene, pornographic, discriminatory, or violent content; promoting harmful misinformation, pseudo-science, or dangerous practices based on misinterpretation or misuse of Platform content **(e.g., using information from a BETO.GROUP vault discussing historical financial events to promote a guaranteed "get rich quick" scheme)**.  
(e) **Spam and Unsolicited Communications:** Sending unsolicited bulk messages, promotions, advertisements, chain letters, spam, or pyramid schemes; harvesting user contact information for unsolicited purposes.  
(f) **NFT-Specific Misconduct:** Manipulating or "wash trading" BETO.GROUP NFTs on any platform **(e.g., repeatedly buying and selling the same BETO.GROUP NFT between accounts you control to artificially inflate its perceived market value or trading volume)**; creating or distributing counterfeit BETO.GROUP NFTs or Associated Art/Content; using BETO.GROUP NFTs or Associated Art/Content in a way that violates the license terms granted in Section 3.3, or for fraudulent or deceptive purposes; attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in any BETO.GROUP NFT Smart Contracts.  
(g) **Impersonation and Misrepresentation:** Impersonating any person or entity, or falsely stating or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, or the source of any information you provide **(e.g., creating a support forum profile that mimics a BETO.GROUP staff member to solicit private information from other users)**.  
(h) **Interference and Abuse of Service:** Disrupting or interfering with the operation, functionality, or security of the Platform (e.g., via DDoS attacks); circumventing security measures, access controls, or rate limits.  
(i) **Unauthorized Use of Data:** Scraping, mining, or otherwise extracting data from the Platform in violation of these Terms or applicable law **(e.g., systematically downloading all user-contributed notes from a shared community vault for republication on another platform without consent)**; using harvested data to compete with BETO.GROUP or to train machine learning models without BETO.GROUP's explicit prior written authorization.

(l) **Circumventing Limitations:** Bypassing usage limits, payment requirements (if any), or attempting to interfere with license enforcement mechanisms for software or Digital Collectibles **(e.g., altering file metadata or system clocks to try and bypass the 6-month MIT Window transition to GPLv3 for a specific software Release)**.  
(m) **Other Harmful Activities:** Engaging in any other activity that BETO.GROUP, in its sole and reasonable discretion, deems to be: (i) harmful, disruptive, or detrimental to the Platform, its operations, or its infrastructure **(e.g., intentionally submitting excessively large files or queries designed to degrade Platform performance for other users)**; (ii) harmful or offensive to other Users or the BETO.GROUP community **(e.g., promoting conspiracy theories known to cause real-world harm or distress within community channels)**; (iii) damaging to BETO.GROUP's reputation or goodwill **(e.g., systematically spreading false or malicious information about BETO.GROUP or its Platform)**; or (iv) otherwise in violation of the spirit or intent of these Terms or any applicable community guidelines that BETO.GROUP may publish from time to time.

**7.1. Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure:** If you discover a security vulnerability in the Platform or any BETO.GROUP Smart Contract, you agree to report it privately and responsibly to BETO.GROUP at legalis@beto.group without exploiting it or disclosing it publicly until BETO.GROUP has had a reasonable opportunity to address it. Adherence to responsible disclosure practices may, at BETO.GROUP’s sole discretion, be eligible for rewards or recognition. Unauthorized attempts to exploit vulnerabilities may result in termination of your Platform access and potential legal action. This does not constitute permission to probe, test, or attempt to breach the security of the Platform without explicit written authorization from BETO.GROUP.

## 8. Termination

**8.1. Termination by BETO.GROUP**

**(a) Grounds for Termination or Suspension for Material Breach:**  
BETO.GROUP may, at its sole discretion, suspend or terminate your access to and use of the Platform (excluding your ownership rights to any lawfully acquired BETO.GROUP NFTs on the Applicable Blockchain Network as per Section 3.1(a) — please verify if 3.1(a) or 3.2(a) is the correct reference for NFT ownership in your final Section 3 — but potentially including Platform-dependent Utility of such NFTs as per Section 8.2(c)) for any **"material breach"** of these Terms. A **"material breach" is generally understood as a significant violation of these Terms that harms or has the potential to harm BETO.GROUP, other users, the integrity or security of the Platform, or fundamentally undermines the parties' agreement.** For the purposes of this Section, material breaches include, but are not limited to, the specific grounds listed below:  
(i) Violation of User Conduct provisions (Section 7), particularly those involving illegal activities, security compromises, intellectual property infringement, or severe harassment;  
(ii) Significant or repeated breach of software licensing rules (Section 1);  
(iii) Significant or repeated breach of terms related to Digital Collectibles (Section 3);  
(iv) Engagement in illegal, fraudulent, or significantly harmful activities through or in connection with the Platform;  
(v) Intentional or repeated circumvention of security measures, Platform usage policies, or licensing enforcement mechanisms;  
(vi) Failure to comply with applicable laws in your use of the Platform in a manner that exposes BETO.GROUP to significant risk or liability;  
(vii) Causing significant actual harm or posing an imminent risk of such harm to BETO.GROUP, its systems, its users, or third parties; or  
(viii) Failure to comply with the obligation to engage in good faith dialogue regarding the Contribution Obligation under Section 2.6(a) after due verification of meeting Success Thresholds, or a clear demonstration of bad faith in such discussions as per Section 2.7(b).
**(b) Notice and Opportunity to Cure (for certain material breaches):**  
(i) **Immediate Action for Severe Breaches:** Notwithstanding Section 8.1(b)(ii), BETO.GROUP reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access **immediately and without prior notice or opportunity to cure** if the material breach, in BETO.GROUP's reasonable determination, involves illegal activities (e.g., Section 8.1(a)(iv)), poses an imminent security threat (e.g., Section 8.1(a)(v) or aspects of (i)), causes or is highly likely to cause significant and irreparable harm to BETO.GROUP or others (e.g., Section 8.1(a)(vii)), or demonstrates a clear pattern of willful or repeated non-compliance.  
(ii) **Discretionary Opportunity to Cure:** For other material breaches not falling under Section 8.1(b)(i), BETO.GROUP **may, at its sole discretion and depending on the nature and severity of the breach, offer you** written notice of the breach and a period of **up to thirty (30) calendar days (or a shorter period if BETO.GROUP reasonably determines that the circumstances, such as ongoing risk or the nature of the breach, warrant a more expedited resolution)** from the date of notice to cure such breach ("Cure Period"). If a Cure Period is offered and you fail to cure the breach to BETO.GROUP's reasonable satisfaction within the specified Cure Period, BETO.GROUP may then proceed with suspension or termination of your access. **The decision to offer a Cure Period, and its length, is at BETO.GROUP's sole discretion.**  
(iii) **Warnings for Minor Violations:** Separately, for conduct deemed a minor violation as described in Section 8.4(a), BETO.GROUP may issue a warning before any further action.
**(c) Nature of Action:** The decision to suspend versus terminate, or to provide a Cure Period, will be made by BETO.GROUP in its reasonable discretion, based on the nature, severity, and impact of the breach, your history with the Platform, and any attempts made by you to rectify the situation.

**8.2. Effect of Termination of Platform Access:**  
**(a) Cessation of Platform Use:** Upon termination of your Platform access, your right to use and access the BETO.GROUP-controlled aspects of the Platform (e.g., Website, proprietary online services, community channels if linked to platform use, access to new software Releases) will immediately cease.  
**(b) Software and Proprietary Materials:** You must cease use of and, if applicable, delete any proprietary software or materials obtained from BETO.GROUP that are not subject to an ongoing open-source license (e.g., GPLv3 as per Section 1) or a surviving license associated with a Digital Collectible (as per Section 3.3, qualified by Section 8.2(c) below) that permits continued use. Your ongoing rights to use, modify, or distribute previously downloaded software Releases remain subject to the specific license terms (MIT or GPLv3) applicable to those Releases.  
**(c) BETO.GROUP NFTs:**  
(i) **Ownership:** Termination of your access to the Platform does not, in itself, affect your ownership of any BETO.GROUP NFTs you lawfully possess on the Applicable Blockchain Network.  
**(ii) Associated Rights & Utility:** Unless the termination is due to a direct and severe violation of Section 3 (Digital Collectibles) or a severe breach of these Terms that fundamentally undermines the integrity of the BETO.GROUP NFT ecosystem (as determined in BETO.GROUP's reasonable discretion, e.g., using an NFT to facilitate significant harm or illegal activity), your license rights to any Associated Art/Content tied to your lawfully owned BETO.GROUP NFTs (as granted in Section 3.3) shall generally survive termination, subject to your ongoing compliance with the terms of those licenses (e.g., restrictions on use in Section 3.3(c)).

However, any **Platform-dependent Utility** of your BETO.GROUP NFTs **may be revoked, suspended, or cease to function upon termination of your Platform access.** This is because such Utilities rely on your continued authorized access to and interaction with the BETO.GROUP Platform itself. "Platform-dependent Utility" refers to benefits or functionalities that require an active, non-terminated account or connection to BETO.GROUP's controlled systems. Examples include, but are not limited to:
- **Gated Access to Digital Content:** Access to exclusive sections of the BETO.GROUP Website, private forums, or specific downloadable software Releases or Obsidian vault content that are only accessible to verified NFT holders through Platform mechanisms.
- **Community Privileges:** Special roles, permissions, or access to private channels within BETO.GROUP's official Discord server or other managed community platforms, where such access is authenticated through your Platform account or NFT ownership verified by BETO.GROUP systems.
- **Software or Feature Unlocks:** Specific features, tools, or functionalities within the BETO.GROUP software or Platform that are activated or made available based on verified ownership of a particular NFT.
- **Eligibility for Future Benefits:** Qualification for future airdrops, early access programs, discounts on new products/services, or other perks that are distributed or managed through the BETO.GROUP Platform and require an active user account in good standing.
- **Platform-Based Governance:** Any rights to participate in voting, proposals, or other governance mechanisms that are facilitated through tools or interfaces on the BETO.GROUP Platform.
- **Redemption of Real-World or Other Digital Benefits:** If an NFT offers the ability to redeem a physical item, a service, or another digital asset through a BETO.GROUP portal, the ability to make that redemption via the Platform would cease.
Essentially, if a utility or benefit tied to your NFT requires you to log in to, interact with, or be recognized by BETO.GROUP's proprietary systems, that utility is Platform-dependent and may be lost if your access to the Platform is terminated.
(iii) **Revocation for Severe Breaches:** Notwithstanding the foregoing, BETO.GROUP reserves the right, in cases of severe or repeated material breaches of these Terms, particularly those involving intellectual property infringement related to Associated Art/Content, misuse of NFT Utility for prohibited activities, or actions that bring BETO.GROUP into significant disrepute, to publicly declare that the licenses and Platform-dependent Utilities associated with specific BETO.GROUP NFTs held by a breaching party are revoked or suspended. While BETO.GROUP cannot seize the NFT itself from the blockchain, such a declaration may impact the NFT's perceived value or usability within the BETO.GROUP ecosystem or on third-party platforms that respect such declarations. This right will be exercised judiciously and with consideration for the severity and impact of the breach.  
**(d) No Refunds:** No refunds or compensation will be provided upon termination of Platform access, except as may be expressly required by applicable law.  
**(e) Remedies:** Termination does not limit any of BETO.GROUP’s other rights or remedies available at law or in equity.

**8.3. Survival:**  
The following Sections shall survive any termination or expiration of these Terms: Preamble, Section 1 (Licensing Model, as applicable to software versions obtained prior to termination and their ongoing license terms), Section 2 (Give Back Mechanism, for obligations accrued prior to termination), Section 3 (Digital Collectibles (NFTs), Utility, and Associated Rights, particularly regarding ownership, disclaimers, intellectual property, and ongoing license terms for NFTs held post-termination, as qualified by Section 8.2(c)), Section 5 (Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability; Indemnification), Section 6 (Feedback), Section 10 (Governing Law and Jurisdiction), Section 11 (Agreement to Terms), this Section 8.3 (Survival), **Section 8.4 (Warnings and Appeals Process, to the extent applicable to pre-termination actions or post-termination appeals submitted within the stipulated timeframe),** Section 12 (Miscellaneous Legal Provisions), and Section 13 (Contact Information).

**8.4. Warnings and Appeals Process**  
**(a) Warnings for Minor Breaches:** BETO.GROUP aims to foster a positive and compliant community. For certain conduct that BETO.GROUP, in its reasonable discretion, deems to be a minor or unintentional first-time violation of these Terms, BETO.GROUP may, but is not obligated to, issue a warning or request corrective action before resorting to suspension or termination of Platform access. Repeated minor violations after a warning may be considered a material breach. The decision to issue a warning instead of immediate termination is at BETO.GROUP’s sole discretion and depends on the nature and severity of the violation.  
**(b) Appeal of Termination:** If your access to the Platform has been terminated by BETO.GROUP, you may appeal this decision by contacting legalis@beto.group within thirty (30) calendar days of receiving the termination notice. Your appeal should include your username or other identifier, the reasons for your appeal, and any supporting evidence or explanation you wish to provide.  
**(c) Appeal Review:** BETO.GROUP will review timely appeals in good faith. The review process may involve re-evaluating the information leading to the termination and any new information provided in the appeal. **If BETO.GROUP, in its sole discretion, determines that the appeal is successful, potential outcomes may include, but are not limited to, reinstatement of your access to the Platform, modification of the initial action taken, or other appropriate remedies as deemed suitable by BETO.GROUP.** However, BETO.GROUP is not obligated to reinstate access or take any specific action even if new information is presented, and the decision following an appeal review will be considered final with respect to BETO.GROUP's internal appeals process. We will endeavor to respond to appeals within a reasonable timeframe, typically within thirty (30) days of receipt of a complete appeal, but this timeframe is not guaranteed.
**(d) No Suspension of Termination:** Submitting an appeal does not automatically suspend the termination. Your access will remain terminated while the appeal is under review, unless BETO.GROUP expressly states otherwise.  
**(e) Scope:** This appeals process applies to termination of Platform access. It may not apply to other actions BETO.GROUP might take, such as content removal or warnings that do not involve termination of overall Platform access.

**9.3. Verification and Termination for Underage Use:**  
BETO.GROUP does not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under the age of 18. If BETO.GROUP becomes aware or has a reasonable belief that a user is under the age of 18 (or the applicable age of majority), BETO.GROUP reserves the right to:  
**(a) Immediately terminate that user's access to and use of the Platform without notice;**  
**(b) Delete any account and associated personal data in accordance with our Privacy Policy; and**  
**(c) Take any other action deemed appropriate by BETO.GROUP.**

**9.4. Compliance with Obsidian Application Requirements:**  
You acknowledge that to use BETO.GROUP's downloadable vault Releases, you must use the Obsidian Application (Obsidian.md), which is a third-party software governed by its own distinct Terms of Service and policies. You are solely responsible for obtaining the Obsidian Application and for understanding and complying with all terms and conditions set forth by Obsidian.md, including any age requirements they may stipulate, independently of these BETO.GROUP Terms.

## **10. Purchases and Payments for Digital Products**

This Section 10 governs any purchase you make of **digital products, content, or services offered for sale by BETO.GROUP** through the Platform or designated third-party platforms authorized by BETO.GROUP (each such item or service, when purchased, is referred to as a “Purchased Product”). Purchased Products may include, but are not limited to:  
(a) Specific Releases of BETO.GROUP’s Obsidian vaults;  
(b) Digital Collectibles (NFTs) offered for sale (distinct from NFTs that may be provided as incidental to other services or for access);  
(c) Digital art, templates, or other downloadable content packs; and  
(d) Access to specific online services, courses, or premium features, if offered for a fee.  
These terms are in addition to all other terms in this Agreement.

**10.1. Product Description and Availability**  
BETO.GROUP will make reasonable efforts to describe Purchased Products accurately. However, we do not warrant that product descriptions or other content are entirely accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. All purchases are subject to availability.

**10.2. Pricing**  
(a) All prices for Purchased Products will be as listed on the Platform or the authorized third-party sales platform at the time of your order.  
(b) Prices are quoted in **United States Dollars (USD)** unless expressly stated otherwise.  
(c) Prices are exclusive of any applicable sales taxes (such as state or local sales tax), Value Added Tax (VAT), Goods and Services Tax (GST), duties, or other governmental charges, which will be added to your total amount due at checkout, where applicable. You are responsible for paying all such taxes and charges based on your location and applicable law.  
(d) BETO.GROUP reserves the right to change prices for Purchased Products at any time without prior notice, but such changes will not affect orders already placed and confirmed.

**10.3. Orders and Payment**  
(a) To make a purchase, you may be required to provide certain information relevant to your transaction, including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your email address.  
(b) You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use any payment method(s) utilized in connection with any transaction.  
(c) By submitting such information, you grant to BETO.GROUP the right to provide such information to third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Ko-fi, Gumroad, or others as we may use) for purposes of facilitating the completion of transactions. You agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of any such third-party payment processor.  
(d) We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to: product availability, errors in the description or price of the product, error in your order, suspected fraud or unauthorized or illegal transaction, or other reasons.  
(e) Your order is an offer to buy. A contract between us for the purchase of a Purchased Product will be formed when we send you an order confirmation email or otherwise make the Purchased Product accessible to you after successful payment.

**10.4. Delivery of Digital Products**  
(a) Upon successful completion of your payment and order confirmation, Purchased Products will be delivered to you digitally.  
(b) Delivery may be made via a download link sent to the email address you provided, by granting you access to a specific area of the Platform, or through other digital means specified at the time of purchase (e.g., NFT airdrop to a provided wallet address if the NFT itself gates access to the content).  
(c) It is your responsibility to ensure that the email address and any other delivery information you provide are accurate and capable of receiving communications and deliveries from us. BETO.GROUP is not responsible for non-delivery due to incorrect information provided by you or issues with your email provider or systems.  
(d) Access to the Purchased Product is typically granted immediately or shortly after payment confirmation, but delays may occur. If your NFT is being delivered via Crossmint as part of the purchase process (as described in your welcome message), please allow up to seven (7) days for NFT processing and delivery which may gate access to the Purchased Product.

**10.5. REFUND POLICY FOR DIGITAL PRODUCTS**
**(a) General Policy: All Sales Are Final.**  
Due to the immediate, digital nature of the Purchased Products (such as downloadable software vaults and digital content) and the access provided upon purchase, **all sales of Purchased Products are generally considered final. BETO.GROUP typically does not offer refunds, returns, or exchanges once a purchase is completed and the Product has been delivered or made accessible.** We encourage you to carefully review all product descriptions, system requirements (if any), available previews or samples, and these Terms before making any purchase. If you have questions about a Purchased Product, please contact us at contact@beto.group before completing your transaction.
**(b) Exception for Mandatory Applicable Law (e.g., Faulty or Misdescribed Products):**  
Notwithstanding the general policy in Section 10.5(a), this policy does not override any **mandatory consumer protection rights applicable in your jurisdiction that cannot be waived by contract.** For example, in certain jurisdictions, you may have a statutory right to a refund or other remedy if a digital product is:  
(i) Significantly not as described on the Platform at the time of purchase;  
(ii) Faulty or not of satisfactory quality, preventing its intended use; or  
(iii) Not fit for a particular purpose that was expressly made known to BETO.GROUP before purchase and BETO.GROUP indicated the product was suitable for that purpose.
**(c) Process for Requesting a Refund Under Mandatory Applicable Law:**  
If you believe you are entitled to a refund or remedy under such mandatory applicable consumer protection laws in your jurisdiction, you must contact BETO.GROUP at legalis@beto.group within a reasonable time (and in any event, within any period prescribed by such applicable law, e.g., often 14 to 30 days from purchase or discovery of a fault). Your request must include:  
(i) Your order details (e.g., order number, date of purchase, email used).  
(ii) A clear explanation of why you believe the Purchased Product is faulty, significantly misdescribed, or otherwise qualifies for a refund under the mandatory laws of your jurisdiction, with specific details and, if possible, supporting evidence (e.g., screenshots).  
BETO.GROUP will review your request in good faith and in accordance with applicable law. If a refund or other remedy is deemed appropriate under such mandatory laws, BETO.GROUP will process it accordingly.
**(d) User Acknowledgment Regarding General Policy:**  
**By completing your purchase, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to our general policy of no refunds as stated in Section 10.5(a), subject only to your non-waivable statutory rights as described in Section 10.5(b). You agree that you are waiving any broader right to a refund or to cancel the purchase once delivery or access has commenced, except as provided by such mandatory, non-waivable laws.**
**(e) BETO.GROUP's Commitment to Accurate Descriptions:**  
BETO.GROUP is committed to providing accurate and clear descriptions of its Purchased Products to help you make informed decisions. If you believe a product description is inaccurate or misleading, please bring it to our attention at contact@beto.group even if you are not seeking a refund, so we may review and correct it if necessary.
**10.6. License Terms for Purchased Products**  
(a) Your purchase of a Purchased Product grants you a license to use that specific Purchased Product in accordance with the terms set forth in Section 1 (Licensing Model) of this Agreement, and any other specific license terms accompanying the Purchased Product.  
(b) For clarity, the specific Release of the software vault you purchase will be subject to the MIT License for its initial six (6) month MIT Window from its date of availability (which may be the date of your purchase or a pre-defined release date), after which it will transition to the GPLv3, as detailed in Section 1.  
(c) The purchase of a Purchased Product does not transfer any ownership rights in the intellectual property of the Purchased Product or BETO.GROUP IP. You are purchasing a license to use the Purchased Product, not the Purchased Product itself.

**10.7. Cancellation Policy**  
As Purchased Products are digital and access is typically provided immediately upon or shortly after successful payment, orders cannot be cancelled once payment has been processed and delivery or access has commenced. If you wish to cancel an order before payment is completed, please do so through the payment interface if possible, or contact us immediately.

**10.8. User Responsibilities
You are responsible for:  
**(a) Ensuring you have the necessary software, specifically a compatible version of the Obsidian Application (Obsidian.md), and appropriate hardware to use the Purchased Product. BETO.GROUP provides vaults designed for the Obsidian Application; obtaining, licensing, and complying with the terms of the Obsidian Application itself is your separate responsibility.**  
(b) Maintaining the security of any download links or access credentials provided to you.  
(c) Backing up any data or customizations you make if you modify the Purchased Product.

----
## 11. Modification of Terms

BETO.GROUP reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, as determined in our reasonable discretion, we will provide at least thirty (30) days' prior notice before such new terms take effect.

**For the purposes of these Terms, "material changes" may include, but are not limited to, changes that:**  
**(a) Significantly alter your rights or obligations, such as modifications to the core Licensing Model (Section 1), the Give Back Mechanism (Section 2), or terms related to Digital Collectibles (Section 3);**  
**(b) Introduce new fees or significantly change existing fee structures (if any are implemented in the future);**  
**(c) Substantially limit your access to or use of significant features of the Platform;**  
**(d) Alter the disclaimers, limitations of liability, or indemnification provisions (e.g., Sections 5, 8.2(d)); or**  
**(e) Modify the Governing Law and Jurisdiction (Section 12) or the newly introduced Appeals Process (Section 8.4).**  
**Non-material changes, such as minor clarifications, typographical corrections, updates to contact information, or changes required by law that do not substantially affect your rights, may be made without the 30-day prior notice period, though the "Last Updated" date will be revised.**

Notification of any material changes will be provided to you primarily via email sent to the last email address you provided to BETO.GROUP (if any). **It is your sole responsibility to ensure that your email address on file with BETO.GROUP is current and accurate at all times to receive such notifications.** BETO.GROUP shall not be liable for your failure to receive notices if your email address is not current or is otherwise unable to receive emails from us. Additionally, or as a secondary method, we may also post a prominent notice on the Platform (e.g., a banner on the Website or a notification within the software).

Your continued access to or use of the Platform after the effective date of such modifications (i.e., after the conclusion of the 30-day notice period for material changes, or immediately upon posting for non-material changes) constitutes your conclusive acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by, the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, your sole recourse is to cease all access and use of the Platform prior to the effective date of the changes (for material changes) or immediately upon becoming aware of them (for non-material changes). It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically for changes, even if you have not received a direct notification due to an outdated email address or other delivery issues.

---

**12.1. Governing Law:**  
These Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them or their subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. BETO.GROUP is based in Alberta, Canada, and this choice of law provides a consistent legal framework.

**12.2. Informal Dispute Resolution (Mandatory First Step):**  
We encourage you to contact us first at legalis@beto.group to seek a resolution for any concerns or disputes arising from these Terms or your use of the Platform. Most user concerns can be resolved quickly and to the user's satisfaction by contacting our support. **Both parties agree to attempt to resolve any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through good faith negotiations for a period of at least thirty (30) days following written notification of the dispute to the other party. This informal resolution process shall be a precondition to either party initiating mediation, arbitration, or a lawsuit (except for matters qualifying for small claims court or urgent injunctive relief as outlined below).**

**12.3. Optional Mediation:**  
If a dispute cannot be resolved through the informal dispute resolution process described in Section 12.2, **the parties may, by mutual written agreement, attempt to settle the dispute by mediation before resorting to arbitration.** Mediation shall be administered by a mutually agreed-upon mediator or mediation service. If mediation is pursued, it may be conducted remotely (e.g., via video conference) to facilitate participation. Each party shall bear its own costs for mediation, and the parties shall share equally the mediator’s fees and expenses, unless otherwise agreed. Engaging in mediation is optional and does not waive either party's right to proceed to arbitration if mediation is unsuccessful or not pursued.

**12.4. Binding Arbitration (Primary Resolution for Disputes Not Resolved Amicably or by Mediation):**  
**(a) Agreement to Arbitrate:** If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution through informal dispute resolution (Section 12.2) **and do not mutually agree to or successfully resolve the dispute through mediation (Section 12.3)**, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the primary means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance, and breach), the parties' relationship with each other, and/or your use of the Platform shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by a recognized arbitration institution (e.g., the ADR Institute of Canada, or another mutually agreed-upon institution) in accordance with its commercial arbitration rules, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.  
**(b) Arbitrator and Rules:** The arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. The arbitrator, and not any federal, provincial, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be in writing and provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions, shall be binding on the parties, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.  
**(c) Location and Language:** The arbitration will be conducted in English. The seat of arbitration shall be Calgary, Alberta, Canada. However, for your convenience, if you are an individual consumer residing outside of Canada, the arbitration hearings may be conducted remotely (e.g., via video conference) or, if mutually agreed or ordered by the arbitrator for fairness, in your county or region of residence.  
**(d) Arbitration Fees:** The responsibility for payment of any arbitration filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the applicable arbitration rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed Ten Thousand USD ($10,000), BETO.GROUP will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose.  
**(e) Exception - Small Claims Court:** Notwithstanding the parties' agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction in Calgary, Alberta, or, if you are an individual consumer, in your local small claims court if permitted by that court's rules.  
**(f) Class Action Waiver:** **THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION (OR COURT PROCEEDING, WHERE APPLICABLE) SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES ONLY AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS.** If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration (or court proceeding) can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above in this Section 12.4 shall be deemed null and void in its entirety with respect to such class claim, and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate such class disputes (though individual claims may still be arbitrable).

**12.5. Exceptions to Arbitration and Jurisdiction for Certain Matters (Renumbered from 12.4):**  
**(a) Injunctive Relief and Intellectual Property:** Notwithstanding the foregoing dispute resolution procedures, BETO.GROUP may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect its intellectual property rights or confidential information, or to prevent or stop (or to address past or ongoing) unauthorized access or use of the Platform in violation of these Terms, in any court of competent jurisdiction, including the courts located in Calgary, Alberta.  
**(b) Consumer Rights in Local Jurisdiction (Limited and Conditional):** If you are an individual consumer (not a business entity) using the Platform for personal, family, or household purposes, **this local court option applies only where mandatory consumer protection laws in your jurisdiction of residence (i) grant you the right to bring claims in your local courts, AND (ii) expressly prohibit you from waiving such jurisdictional rights in a pre-dispute agreement like these Terms.** If both these conditions are met, then for disputes that qualify as consumer disputes under such laws and cannot be resolved by arbitration as set forth above (e.g., if your local law also prohibits pre-dispute arbitration agreements for such consumer claims or makes the class action waiver unenforceable for such claims), you may bring your claim in the courts of your jurisdiction of residence. However, for all other disputes, and for all business users, the terms of Section 12.4 (Binding Arbitration) and Section 12.6 (Exclusive Jurisdiction for Court Proceedings) shall apply.  
**(c) Governing Law Still Applies:** Even if a consumer dispute is heard in your local court under Section 12.5(b), the governing law as stated in Section 12.1 (Alberta law) shall still apply to the substance of the dispute, to the maximum extent permissible by your local mandatory consumer protection laws.

**12.6. Exclusive Jurisdiction for Court Proceedings (Not Subject to Arbitration or Permitted Local Consumer Courts - Renumbered from 12.5):**  
Except for matters properly brought in small claims court, consumer disputes eligible for local jurisdiction under Section 12.5(b), or for injunctive relief sought by BETO.GROUP under Section 12.5(a), you irrevocably agree that any legal action, suit, or proceeding arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Platform that is not subject to binding arbitration under Section 12.4, or for enforcement of an arbitration award, shall be brought exclusively in the courts located in the City of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, Canada ("Calgary Courts"). This specific location is chosen for its connection to BETO.GROUP's operational base and to ensure that legal matters are handled efficiently within this established legal system. You hereby irrevocably consent and submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such Calgary Courts for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.

**12.7. Acknowledgment by International Users (General - Renumbered from 12.6):**  
If you are accessing or using the Platform from a jurisdiction outside of Canada, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. You acknowledge and agree that by using the Platform and accepting these Terms, you are consenting to the dispute resolution mechanisms (including informal resolution, optional mediation, and binding arbitration) and jurisdictional provisions outlined herein, subject to any non-waivable mandatory consumer protection rights applicable in your country of residence. You acknowledge that resolving disputes even via remote processes or in Canadian courts may involve challenges and costs, and you willingly accept these as a condition of using the Platform.

Your access to and use of the BETO.GROUP Website and Platform are expressly conditioned upon your explicit agreement to these Terms.

**13.1. Website Use:**  
By accessing or using the Website, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the then-current version of these Terms as they apply to general website use.

**13.2. Platform Use (Including Software Downloads and NFT Interactions):**  
To access and use the Platform's core functionalities (including any downloaded software or vault, and any interaction with BETO.GROUP NFTs or related services), you must explicitly agree to these Terms. Prior to your first use of such functionalities, or at the point of acquiring a BETO.GROUP NFT or accessing related services, you will be presented with these Terms (or a direct link thereto) and required to affirmatively indicate your acceptance by checking a mandatory box (e.g., "I have read, understood, and agree to the BETO.GROUP Terms of Service and Privacy Policy") or by other means of express consent. Access to and use of such Platform functionalities is prohibited unless and until such agreement is provided.

**13.3. Binding Agreement:**  
Your affirmative act of checking an acceptance box, clicking an "I Agree" button (or similar consent mechanism), and/or proceeding to access or use the Platform after being presented with these Terms, constitutes a binding legal agreement between you and BETO.GROUP.

**13.4. Relevance of Software Version in Disputes:**  
In the event of a dispute specifically concerning the licensing status (per Section 1) or technical functionality of a particular software Release, you may be reasonably required to provide information identifying that specific Release to facilitate resolution.

**13.5. Withdrawal of Consent and Account Deletion:**  
You may withdraw your consent to these Terms at any time by:  
**(a) Ceasing all access to and use of the Platform (including the Website, any downloaded software subject to these Terms, and any services related to BETO.GROUP NFTs that require ongoing agreement to these Terms); AND**  
**(b) If you have an account or have provided personal data you wish to have deleted, notifying BETO.GROUP in writing at legalis@beto.group with a clear request to delete your account and associated personal data, subject to the conditions and limitations outlined in our Privacy Policy (particularly regarding data retention for legal or legitimate business purposes).**

**Upon effective withdrawal of consent and/or account deletion:**  
**(i) Your right to access and use the Platform under these Terms will immediately cease.**  
**(ii) Certain obligations and rights will survive, as detailed in Section 8.3 (Survival). For instance, your obligations regarding software already downloaded will continue to be governed by the applicable licenses (MIT or GPLv3 as per Section 1), and any BETO.GROUP NFTs you own will remain your property on the blockchain, though Platform-dependent utility may cease as per Section 8.2(c).**  
**(iii) BETO.GROUP will process your data deletion request in accordance with our Privacy Policy and applicable law.**

**(a) By User:** Except as may be expressly permitted by BETO.GROUP in connection with specific, designated Digital Collectibles (e.g., NFTs) made available on a BETO.GROUP-approved platform and subject to separate terms governing such assets (as referenced in Section 3), you may not assign, transfer, delegate, or sublicense any of your rights or obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of BETO.GROUP. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation hereof will be null and void and shall constitute a material breach of these Terms.  
**(b) By BETO.GROUP:** BETO.GROUP may assign, transfer, delegate, or sublicense its rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, without restriction, including without your consent or notice to you (except as may be required by applicable law), in connection with: (i) a merger, consolidation, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of BETO.GROUP's assets or business related to the Platform; (ii) any corporate reorganization; or (iii) a transfer to an affiliated entity. These Terms will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

**14.10. Force Majeure:** 
BETO.GROUP shall not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of its obligations hereunder where such failure or delay results from any cause beyond BETO.GROUP's reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, natural disasters (such as fire, flood, earthquake, storm), war, terrorism, riots, insurrections, civil unrest, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, pandemics, epidemics, strikes, lockouts or other labor disputes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor, or materials, or failures of public or private telecommunications networks, interruptions or failures of the Internet or any Applicable Blockchain Network, or other catastrophic events or any other occurrences which are beyond our reasonable control (a "Force Majeure Event").

Nothing in these Terms shall be construed as creating any agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer, or franchisor-franchisee relationship between you and BETO.GROUP. You agree that your use of the Platform is as an independent user, and you are not an agent or employee of BETO.GROUP for any purpose.
