# Third-Party Software Notices and Licenses

This BETO.GROUP software Release is designed to work optimally with, or its functionality may be significantly enhanced by, certain third-party plugins available for the Obsidian Application. These plugins are separate pieces of software created and maintained by their respective developers and are governed by their own licenses.

**You, the user, are responsible for installing these plugins from their official sources (e.g., the Obsidian Community Plugins list or their GitHub repositories) and for understanding and complying with their individual license terms.**

BETO.GROUP does not distribute these plugins directly with this Release (unless explicitly stated otherwise for a specific component). We are not responsible for these third-party plugins, their functionality, security, or data practices.

Below is a list of commonly recommended or utilized third-party plugins with this vault, along with information about their typical licensing and where to find more details:

**Important Considerations for Users:**
*   Always obtain plugins from trusted, official sources.
*   Review the license for each plugin you install. Most Obsidian community plugins use permissive licenses like MIT, but it's your responsibility to check.
*   The functionality and availability of these third-party plugins are outside of BETO.GROUP's control.
